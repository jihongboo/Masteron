Some of them may be tired or having a bad day. Or you might.</p>\n\n<p>You don&#x27;t have to agree with someone to be civil to them. If you can&#x27;t be civil to someone, leave them\n    alone.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&#x27;t wish to interact with someone, or see any of their posts, there are tools at your disposal\n    including mute and block functions.</p>\n\n<p>If someone&#x27;s posts make you angry or upset, take some time to calm down before you reply. You might also try\n    simply excusing yourself from a conversation and ask them to untag you if you no longer wish to discuss a topic.</p>\n\n<div style=\"padding-top:1em;\"></div>\n\n<p>When someone asks you to leave them alone, leave them alone. If you feel like you can&#x27;t control your urge to\n    respond to that person, use the block or mute feature so you won&#x27;t see their posts and be tempted.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that while you cannot control other people&#x27;s behavior, you are still responsible for your own\n    conduct, even if you feel someone was rude to you or someone else.</p>\n\n<p>We will not allow abusive or disruptive conduct by or toward users on social.tchncs.de. This includes continuing to\n    engage in conversation with someone who has specifically requested you leave them alone, inciting other users to\n    engage with that person on your behalf, aggregating and posting another person&#x27;s personal information without\n    their consent, and inciting others to engage with that person on other platforms. Blocking someone and then sitting\n    on the other side of a block and continuing to talk about that person is also a provoking behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Before you post, think about whether this is the kind of thing you would like to see (or would like your mom or kids\n    to see) in the public timeline. There are post visibility settings that give you some control over which timelines\n    your post appears in, and also CW and NSFW buttons to hide specific text and images in your post. Be a good social\n    media neighbor and use these functions when appropriate.</p>\n\n<p><hr class=\"spacer\">\n<p>Content not allowed on social.tchncs.de</p>\n<ul class=\"bullet\">\n        <li>Sexual depictions of children</li>\n        <li>Content illegal in Germany and&#x2F;or France, such as holocaust denial or Nazi symbolism; Antisemitism, Antiziganism or related. </li>\n        <li>Conduct promoting the ideology of National Socialism</li>\n<li>Content that is considered to be misinformation/conspiracy</li></ul>\n<hr class=\"spacer\">\n<p>Content which will be removed from the public timeline:</p>\n<ul class=\"bullet\">\n        <li>Excessive advertising</li>\n        <li>Untagged pornography- and sexually explicit content</li>\n        <li>Untagged gore and extremely graphic violence</li>\n    <p>We will also remove any content we judge to be hateful toward specific individuals or groups, or intended to\n        cause or incite harm from the public timeline.

If you have any questions about potential bots, please feel free to ask.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br /><br /><br />\n\n<p>Here are some more detailed rules for the instance:</p>\n\n\n<h2>Our Goal</h2>\n\n<p>This community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free\n  experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants\n  in any form.</p>\n\n<h2>Applicability and Scope</h2>\n\n<p>This code of conduct applies to all of this community's spaces,\n  including public channels, private channels and direct messages, both\n  online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be\n  sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the\n  administrators.</p>\n\n<h2>Toward a Welcoming and Safe Environment</h2>\n\n<p>We hope to create an environment in which diverse individuals can\n  collaborate and interact in a positive and affirming way. Examples of\n  behavior that contributes to creating this sort of environment\n  include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>\n  <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>\n  <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>\n  <li>Focusing on what is best for the overall community</li>\n  <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Anti-Harassment Statement</h2>\n\n<p>This community will not tolerate harassment of any kind. Examples\n  of harassment include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, pregnancy status, veteran status, political affiliation, marital status, body size, age, race, national origin, ethnic origin, nationality, immigration status, language, religion or lack thereof, or other identity marker. This includes anti-Indigenous/Nativeness and anti-Blackness.</li>\n  <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, relationships, drugs, and employment.</li>\n  <li>Deliberate misgendering, using inappropriate pronouns, or use of \"dead\" or rejected names.</li>\n  <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they're not appropriate.</li>\n  <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like \"hug\" or \"backrub\") without consent or after a request to stop.</li>\n  <li>Threats of violence.</li>\n  <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual or group, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.</li>\n  <li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>\n  <li>Stalking or following - online or in the physical world.</li>\n  <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.</li>\n  <li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>\n  <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>\n  <li>Patterns of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.</li>\n  <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.</li>\n  <li>Deliberate \"outing\" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.</li>\n  <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li>\n  <li>Jokes that resemble the above, such as \"hipster racism\", still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have questions or concerns about these issues please feel free to message an admin or ask for an opportunity to explore the issue with a moderator and volunteers.</p>\n\n<h2>Reporting</h2>\n\n<p>If you think that an account on this instance is violating this Code of Conduct, or is doing something offensive or should be otherwise handled by the administrators, the easiest way to report them is to use the reporting tool that is part of Mastodon. You can do that using the 'Report' tool which is embedded in every toot:\n  <br>\n    <img src=\"/report.png\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>If you would rather not use the reporting tool, if the harassment\n  is happening outside of botsin.space, or if you have any other\n  concerns, please contact the administrators via the methods listed at\n  the top of this page. If the person who is harassing you is on the\n  admin team, they will not be involved in handling or resolving the\n  incident.</p>\n\n<p>The admin team will respond to any complaint as promptly as\n  possible we can. If you do not get a timely response (for example, if no admins are currently online) then please put your personal safety and well-being first, and consider logging out and/or contacting the admins by email at colin at muffinlabs dot com.</p>\n\n<p>This code of conduct applies to our community's spaces, but if you\n  are being harassed by a member of our community outside our spaces, we\n  still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of\n  harassment by our members, especially the administrators,\n  seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment\n  that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the\n  right to exclude people from the community based on their past\n  behavior, including behavior outside of our spaces and behavior\n  towards people who are not in this community.</p>\n\n<p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve\n  the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad\n  faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted\n  without response.</p>\n\n<h2>Enforcement Process</h2>\n\n<p>Every code of conduct violation report will be treated with\n  seriousness and care. If a member's immediate safety and security is\n  threatened, an individual admin may take any action that they deem\n  appropriate, up to and including temporarily banning the offender from\n  the community. In less urgent situations, at least two admins will\n  discuss the offense and mutually arrive at a suitable response, which\n  will be shared with the offender privately. Whatever the resolution\n  that they decide upon, the decision of the admins involved in a\n  violation case will be considered final.</p>\n\n<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of\n  protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a\n  person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately\n  warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will\n  increase the safety of our members or the general public. We will not\n  name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>\n\n<h2>Consequences</h2>\n\n<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to\n  comply immediately.

CWやNSFWはちゃんと使ってください</h4>\n\n<p>\n  誰かが不快になりそうだと思った文章を投稿したい時にはContent Warning(CW)を、画像にはNot Safe For Work(NSFW)タグを付けてください。警告文には、見たくない人が投稿の内容を表示しないでスルーできるような説明を書いてください(例: エロ, グロ, 長文, Undertaleネタバレ)。たとえ付けていても日本法に抵触するような画像を投稿する行為は禁止です。<br>\n  とはいえ、正直なところ1人でも傷つく可能性がある投稿には全てCWを付けろと言ってもキリが無くなってしまいます。特にローカルTLや連合TLはたくさんの人の発言がほぼフィルタリングされずに流れてくるタイムラインです。それらのタイムラインを覗くときには不愉快な投稿が目に見えてしまう可能性があると言うことをある程度割り切ってください。\n</p>\n\n<h4>3. 他人に迷惑をかけたり、不快にするような行為は禁止です</h4>\n\n<p>連投やフォロ爆などの過度に迷惑がかかる投稿は禁止です。スパムにしか見えないような宣伝とかもやめてね。</p>\n\n<h4>4. みんな仲良く</h4>\n\n<p>\n  ブロックとかミュートとかあるからね、絶対に仲良くできなさそうな人がいたら突っかかる前に距離を取ろうね。ブロックしました報告とかもトラブルの元になるだけだからやめようね。<br>\n  人に自分ルールを押し付けて不快にさせる行為も禁止です。あなたのルールはここのルールではありません。ネタだとしても不快にさせる時点でよくありません。\n</p>\n\n<p><hr style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"></p>\n\n<h3>Bot運用ルール</h3>\n\n<p>\n  ある程度プログラムが書ける人の中には、API経由で投稿ができるWebサービスを見つけたら何かボットを作ってみたくなる人も多いことかと思いますが、そういった方々にお願いがあります。\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Mastodonの根幹となる要素に「連合」というものがあります。これは、リモートフォローをすることによって他のインスタンスのアカウントとも繋がることが出来るという、従来主流であったSNSには存在しなかった要素です。\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Mastodonには連合の仕組みがあり、他のインスタンスからリモートフォローを受けることができるため、何百、何千とあるインスタンスのうち、いずれか一つのインスタンスにBotアカウントを設置していれば、使いたい人はそれをリモートフォローしに行くことができます。\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  ですから、わざわざ他のインスタンスにも設置したBotをわざわざmstdn.jpにも設置するようなことは絶対にしないでください。そのようなBotに対してはサイレンス処理を行うことがあります。\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  また、ローカルタイムラインや連合タイムラインは、日常的に閲覧する用途に向いていないタイムラインではありますが、交流したい人を探す用途に用いられていることは確かですので、なるべく自動投稿の類が表示されることを避けたいと思っています。そこでmstdn.jpにBotを設置しようと考えている方々には、最低限以下の条件を守って頂きたいと思います:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Publicな投稿をしないこと(Unlisted, Private, Directを使ってください)</li>\n  <li>能動的に他のアカウントをフォローしに行かないこと</li>\n  <li>フォローしていない人のトゥートを自動でお気に入り登録したり、リプライを飛ばしたりしないこと</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n  意図としては、Twitterの<a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/ja/rules-and-policies/twitter-automation\">自動化ルール</a>と同じような感じです。許可なくスパムのような挙動をしていると判断したbotはサイレンス、アカウント停止などの措置を取らせて頂きます。\n</p>\n\n<p><hr style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"></p>\n\n<h3>ソースコード</h3>\n\n<p>mstdn.jpにデプロイされているMastodonのソースコードは以下のレポジトリから入手できます: <a href=\"https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/\">https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/</a></p>\n\n<p><hr style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"></p>\n\n<h3>お問い合わせ先</h3>\n\n<p>お問い合わせは，<a href=\"mailto:info@sujitech.com\">メール</a>でお願いします．</p>\n\n<p><hr></p>\n\n<p>上記を、本インスタンスのルールと定めます。</p>\n",

CWやNSFWはちゃんと使ってください</h4> \n\n<p> \n\n  誰かが不快になりそうだと思った文章を投稿したい時にはContent Warning(CW)を、画像にはNot Safe For Work(NSFW)タグを付けてください。警告文には、見たくない人が投稿の内容を表示しないでスルーできるような説明を書いてください(例: エロ, グロ, 長文, Undertaleネタバレ)。たとえ付けていても日本法に抵触するような画像を投稿する行為は禁止です。<br> \n\n  とはいえ、正直なところ1人でも傷つく可能性がある投稿には全てCWを付けろと言ってもキリが無くなってしまいます。特にローカルTLや連合TLはたくさんの人の発言がほぼフィルタリングされずに流れてくるタイムラインです。それらのタイムラインを覗くときには不愉快な投稿が目に見えてしまう可能性があると言うことをある程度割り切ってください。 \n\n</p> \n\n<h4>3. 他人に迷惑をかけたり、不快にするような行為は禁止です</h4> \n\n<p>連投やフォロ爆などの過度に迷惑がかかる投稿は禁止です。スパムにしか見えないような宣伝とかもやめてね。</p> \n\n<h4>4. みんな仲良く</h4> \n\n<p> \n\n  ブロックとかミュートとかあるからね、絶対に仲良くできなさそうな人がいたら突っかかる前に距離を取ろうね。ブロックしました報告とかもトラブルの元になるだけだからやめようね。<br> \n\n  人に自分ルールを押し付けて不快にさせる行為も禁止です。あなたのルールはここのルールではありません。ネタだとしても不快にさせる時点でよくありません。 \n\n</p> \n\n<p><hr style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"> </p>\n\n<h3>Bot運用ルール</h3> \n\n<p> \n\n  ある程度プログラムが書ける人の中には、API経由で投稿ができるWebサービスを見つけたら何かボットを作ってみたくなる人も多いことかと思いますが、そういった方々にお願いがあります。 \n\n</p> \n\n<p> \n\n  Mastodonの根幹となる要素に「連合」というものがあります。これは、リモートフォローをすることによって他のインスタンスのアカウントとも繋がることが出来るという、従来主流であったSNSには存在しなかった要素です。 \n\n</p> \n\n<p> \n\n  Mastodonには連合の仕組みがあり、他のインスタンスからリモートフォローを受けることができるため、何百、何千とあるインスタンスのうち、いずれか一つのインスタンスにBotアカウントを設置していれば、使いたい人はそれをリモートフォローしに行くことができます。 \n\n</p> \n\n<p> \n\n  ですから、わざわざ他のインスタンスにも設置したBotをわざわざ Pawooにも設置するようなことは絶対にしないでください。そのようなBotに対してはサイレンス処理を行うことがあります。 \n\n</p> \n\n<p> \n\n  また、ローカルタイムラインや連合タイムラインは、日常的に閲覧する用途に向いていないタイムラインではありますが、交流したい人を探す用途に用いられていることは確かですので、なるべく自動投稿の類が表示されることを避けたいと思っています。そこで Pawoo にBotを設置しようと考えている方々には、最低限以下の条件を守って頂きたいと思います: \n\n</p> \n\n<ul> \n\n  <li>Publicな投稿をしないこと(Unlisted, Private, Directを使ってください)</li> \n\n  <li>能動的に他のアカウントをフォローしに行かないこと</li> \n\n  <li>フォローしていない人のトゥートを自動でお気に入り登録したり、リプライを飛ばしたりしないこと</li> \n\n</ul> \n\n<p> \n\n  意図としては、Twitterの<a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/ja/rules-and-policies/twitter-automation\">自動化ルール</a>と同じような感じです。許可なくスパムのような挙動をしていると判断したbotはサイレンス、アカウント停止などの措置を取らせて頂きます。 \n\n</p> \n\n<p><hr style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"> </p>\n\n<h3>お問い合わせ先</h3> \n\n<p>お問い合わせは，<a href=\"mailto:pawoo-support@sujitech.com\">メール</a>でお願いします．</p> \n\n<p><hr> </p>\n\n<p>上記を、本インスタンスのルールと定めます。</p> \n",

Be respectful and sincerely apologize if someone informs you that a boundary has been crossed. Give people space if you accidentally push past a boundary.</li></p>\n\n<p><li>If you find yourself involved in a conflict and are worried about the situation escalating, contact @Curator or any of the mods listed above.</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Tag sensitive content such as violence/blood, graphic nudity, lewd content, and other potentially upsetting or triggering topics and hide them under a Content Warning (CW). CWs are a big part of the culture of the Fediverse, and CWing potentially upsetting content is how we keep our community and the wider Fediverse safe and supportive for everyone. (We also recommend people CW political posts, but we will not mandate it.)</li></p>\n\n<p></ol></p>\n\n<p></li></p>\n\n<p><li>All users, local and remote, will be considered in the wrong if they participate in the following:</p>\n\n<p><ol type=\"a\"></p>\n\n<p><li>Microaggressions (&quot;not all men&quot;, white/man/cis-splaining etc.), ableism, deliberate mis-gendering</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Demanding education on problematic behaviour from a non-admin/moderator</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Skirting the lines of being a troll, or directly trolling</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Sharing DM screenshots or quotes from DMs or private communications publicly without all parties&#39; permission</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Creating memes about someone without their permission</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Ranting or engaging in long rambling tangents on public timelines about a particular user without explicitly naming them (also known as &quot;subtooting&quot;)</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Not tagging potentially sensitive or triggering toots</li></p>\n\n<p></ol></p>\n\n<p>This is not an exhaustive list, and all moderation decisions are ultimately left up to the discretion of our mod team.

This includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors:</p>\n\n<p><ol type=\"a\"></p>\n\n<p><li>Continuing to engage in conversation with a user that has specifically requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist may be considered harassment, regardless of platform-specific privacy tools employed.</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Aggregating, posting, and/or disseminating a person&#39;s demographic, personal, or private data without express permission (informally called &quot;doxing&quot;) will be considered harassment.</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Inciting users to engage another user in continued interaction or discussion after a user has requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist (informally called &quot;brigading&quot; or &quot;dogpiling&quot;) may be considered harassment.</li></p>\n\n<p></ol></p>\n\n<p></li></p>\n\n<p><li>Please do not flood the local timeline. We define &quot;flooding&quot; as posting mutliple posts in quick succession to the local/public timeline (but the definition is flexible; judgements on flooding will be made in context). Flooding drowns out other users and annoys instances we federate with. \n    <ul><li>You can reply to the toots of others and banter back and forth as much as you want, as replies aren&#39;t shown on the local/public timelines.</li>\n    <li>Please avoid posting many pieces of art/media all at once. Sticking to one post per ten minutes (with one-four pictures attached) is a good baseline to follow. Please respect others&#39; content and statuses so that they can discover other artists in the local timeline.\n    <li>If you&#39;d like to post long threads of many toots, consider marking the first toot as &quot;public&quot;, and the rest in replies marked as &quot;unlisted&quot;. This will allow users to click through the first toot to read the rest of the thread without flooding the local/public timelines.</li></ul>\n   </li></p>\n\n<p><li><strong>Regarding nudity/lewd/explicit content:</strong> <br>\n <p>  It&#39;s considered good form to put nudity behind a CW as a courtesy for other users in the fediverse at large, and we encourage this practice. Recognizing the subjectivity of the matter, we consider this a recommendation rather than a hard rule where <em>very light</em> nudity with no genitalia showing is concerned, and we will approach any reports or complaints on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n     <ul><li>Illustrative nudity and body/anatomy studies with very visible genitalia, and titillating / erotic imagery intended for mature audiences,  are allowed on •ART, but <strong>only</strong> if tagged appropriately (ex. #lewd, #nudity, etc.) and marked as sensitive or placed under a descriptive content warning.\n       <ul><li>Tags are required so people have the opportunity to filter such content from their timelines altogether.</li>\n       <li>Descriptive text is required so that people can make an informed decision about whether to engage with the content behind the CW/image blur.</li>\n        <li>If you&#39;re unsure whether to mark a work as sensitive or post it under a Content Warning, consider the following hypothetical questions: Is it something you&#39;d be comfortable viewing in a white collar work situation? Is it something you&#39;d be comfortable being viewed by a minor? Would you happily show it to your parents? A no to any of these questions may require it being CWed/marked as sensitive. If you&#39;re still unsure, marking it as sensitive/CWing it is a good bet.\n        <li>Another way to decide whether to mark a work as sensitive or post it under a Content Warning is to remember the <strong>Three B&#39;s</strong>: If your work features any <strong>B</strong>oobs, <strong>B</strong>utts, or <strong>B</strong>its (genitals), hide that sucker!</li>\n       </ul>\n       </li>\n     <li>Loli or sexual content with characters of questionable age, as well as &#39;ageing up&#39; characters from fandoms that are minors in order to depict them in sexual situations, is expressly prohibited — your account will be suspended. (This includes cub porn.) \n       </li>\n      <li>Nude photographs are only allowed if done in an artistic spirit — however, it still needs to be tagged and CWed/marked as sensitive. Erotic photography, pornography, or photography that puts too much emphasis on the genitals is <strong>not allowed</strong>, even if marked &quot;Unlisted&quot;/&quot;Followers Only&quot;.</li>\n      <li>We understand that these things are subjective, but final interpretation of these rules are up to our moderation team.</li></ul></p>\n\n<p><li>Gore, vore, and blood violence must also be placed under a descriptive content warning or marked sensitive.</li></p>\n\n<p><li> No NFT content. No advertising NFTs, no selling NFTs, no linking to off-platform NFTs or NFT content, no images connected to NFTs.</li></p>\n\n<p><li> AI-generated imagery (images generated by a neural network that has been trained using other people&#39;s work without their consent) is not allowed at all. Sharing links to external articles discussing AI imagery is fine, but if the article will place a preview of an AI-generated image in your toot, please place it behind a content warning.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><li>•ART&#39;s administration team reserves the right to refuse service to anyone, as well as to remove your data at any time due to inactivity of any duration (to help against future unmonitored accounts from being hacked and becoming spam bots), unethical use, or usage against •ART’s CoC/ToS.

The intended use of this feature\n    is to provide a way to discuss sensitive and/or potentially harmful topics\n    without causing duress or harm to anyone who might stumble upon it, though\n    content warnings may be used for a wide variety of reasons.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Images can be marked as sensitive. This is a feature which hides an image\n    until a warning banner is clicked. Images may be marked as sensitive\n    separately from Content Warnings, though using a Content Warning\n    automatically marks the toot's images as sensitive.\n</p>\n\n<p>Please note that our sensitive media rules apply to profile photos and headers as well. Since those images cannot be hidden behind sensitive media warnings, they are not allowed to contain content from enforced content warnings.</p>\n\n<p>\n    We cannot enforce content warnings on users from other instances, but can\n    help to manage content that you see when reported to instance moderators.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Please be clear and accurate when labeling content warnings, to ensure that\n    they follow both the letter and spirit of the enforcements that we have.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    <strong>\n        Above all, try to be polite, and come from a place of mutual respect\n        when discussing content warnings with other.

Wie überall müssen daher gewisse Regeln gelten, deren Einhaltung durch uns überwacht wird.<br />\n<br />\nOberstes Gebot soll die gegenseitige Rücksichtnahme sein. Die Tatsache, dass dies ein öffentlicher Internetdienst ist und man sich nicht physisch gegenübersteht, entbindet nicht von den Grundregeln menschlichen Zusammenlebens und einem Mindestmaß an Benehmen.<br />\n<br />\nBedenke: Jeder Beitrag wird im Fediverse (Öffentlich, an Follower:innen oder an Einzelpersonen je nach Einstellung) veröffentlicht. Also <em>denke nach bevor du etwas teilst!</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>1. Allgemeines</strong></p>\nAlle Verstöße oder Aufrufe zum Verstoß gegen deutsches Recht sind untersagt und werden geahndet.\n<br>\n<br />\nUnsere Moderationsrichtlinien sowie weitere Informationen könnt ihr im öffentlichen Codeberg-Repository\n<a href=\"https://codeberg.org/Anoxinon_e.V./Organisation\">Organisation</a> einsehen.\n<br>\n<p><strong>2. Beiträge</strong></p></p>\n\n<p>2.1) Beiträge mit rassistischen, illegalen, pornografischen oder gewaltverherrlichenden Inhalten sind strengstens untersagt. Unter diese Regel fallen auch Avatare und Verweise zu Seiten mit entsprechenden Inhalten (bspw. Cracks, Hacks &amp; Warez).\n<br>\n<p>2.2) Das massenweise Erstellen von Beiträgen (sogenanntes Spamming) in einem kurzen Zeitraum ist untersagt.<br /></p>\n\n<p>2.3) Die Veröffentlichung von nicht öffentlichen Gesprächen (E-Mail, XMPP etc.) ist nur dann erlaubt, wenn alle beteiligten Parteien ihre Erlaubnis dazu gegeben haben.<br /></p>\n\n<p>2.4) Beleidigungen und Belästigungen sind generell verboten. Darunter fallen auch jegliche Formen der Diffamierung, Hetze, übler Nachrede und dergleichen.<br />\n<br />\n2.5) Die Funktion des „Content Warning“ (Bild ist hinter einer Warnung) und taggen von „NSFW“ (Not Safe for Work, Text ist hinter einer Warnung) sollte für Beiträge benutzt werden, die potenziell nicht für alle Altersgruppen geeignet sind oder provokante Inhalte enthalten. (z.B.: Schwarzer Humor) <em>Hinweis: Es gibt auch die Option Beiträge nicht in der öffentlichen Timeline erscheinen zu lassen.</em><br />\n<br />\n2.6) Hyperlinks in Beiträgen dürfen weder Tracking-, Werbe- noch Partnerparameter (Affiliate) enthalten (z.B. amp, analytics, ads, ppc, cpc). Verweise zu Seiten welche nachweislich gefährlich sind oder betrügerische Absichten hegen, sind verboten.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. Konto</strong></p>\n3.1) Jeder Nutzerin und jedem Nutzer steht maximal ein Konto zu. Mehrfachanmeldungen sind nur mit schriftlicher Zustimmung von uns gestattet. (Bspw. zur Erstellung eines Projektkontos, oder zum Betreiben von Bots oder Zweitkonten).\n<p>3.2) Konten für kommerzielle Zwecke erfordern eine schriftliche Erlaubnis unsererseits. Die Anfrage ist formfrei per E-Mail an postfach@anoxinon.de zu richten. Das Konto muss aktiv im Fediverse, auf Mastodon teilnehmen. Interaktion in Form von nicht automatisierten, menschlichen Antworten auf Anfragen ist zu gewährleisten. Werbe- und Informationsveröffentlichungen sind in Anzahl und Umfang möglichst gering zu halten.</p>\n<p>3.3) Wir behalten uns vor, Konten, die über 365 Tage keine Anmeldeaktivität aufweisen zu löschen.<br />\n<br />\n3.4) Wir behalten uns vor, der Nutzerin oder dem Nutzer die Lizenz zur Nutzung des Dienstes zeitweise oder dauerhaft, jederzeit und ohne Angaben von Gründen zu entziehen. Ausgenommen davon sind gesetzliche Verpflichtungen und Bestimmungen.<br />\n<br />\n3.5) Die Registrierung über ein Google-Mail Konto ist ausgesetzt und aktuell nicht möglich. Dies war aufgrund zahlreicher Spam accounts leider notwendig.\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>4. Bots/Bugs</strong></p>\n4.1) Das Betreiben von Bots (automatisierte Konten) ist verboten, ausgenommen davon sind sogenannte „RSS Bots“. Alle anderen Bots benötigen die schriftliche Zustimmung von unserer Seite.\n<br>\n<br>\n4.2) Bugs und andere Fehler sind uns zu melden. Ein bewusstes Ausnutzen dieser Bugs ist untersagt.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sanktionen</strong></li>\n<br>\n<br>\nZuwiderhandlungen gegen diese Regeln werden in der Regel mit Ermahnung, Verwarnung oder Sperre geahndet. Bei schweren Verstößen, oder Verdacht auf Mutwilligkeit beim Verstoß behalten wir uns die Sperrung aller Konten bis hin zu einem Hausverbot für das gesamte Anoxinon.de Netzwerk vor. Sperrungen von Konten sind grundsätzlich personenbezogen. Bei einer Kontosperre darf kein weiteres Konto von derselben Nutzerin oder demselben Nutzer erstellt oder benutzt werden.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Schlussworte</strong><br />\n<br />\nWir behalten uns vor, diese Nutzungsbedingungen jederzeit zu ändern sofern dies notwendig sein sollte. Dies betrifft u.a. technische und/oder rechtliche Änderungen sowie Vorkommnisse welche das Betreiben unserer Instanz massiv stören bzw. einschränken würden.

Not owned by a billionaire.</p>\n\n<p><br/> <br/></p>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t want your <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/234876/the-attention-merchants-by-tim-wu/\">attention</a> or your clicks. We&#39;re not the One TTRPG Network To Rule Them All. Just a place for people who enjoy tabletop RPGs to talk about stuff, not at all limited to games.</p>\n\n<p><br/> <br/></p>\n\n<h2>Why Join?</h2>\n\n<p>There&#39;s two parts to that: why Mastodon and why Dice Camp?</p>\n\n<h3>Why use Mastodon?</h3>\n\n<p>As an open distributed social network Mastodon provides some of the things you might like in a social network but with interests more aligned with your own.</p>\n\n<p><br/> <br/></p>\n\n<p>A for-profit social network wants to drive profit through increasing usage and ads as far as possible.</p>\n\n<p><br/> <br/></p>\n\n<p>Mastodon isn&#39;t owned by anyone. Nobody is going to try to show you ads or maximize engagement.</p>\n\n<h3>Why join Dice Camp?</h3>\n\n<p>Since Mastodon is distributed you can join any instance and connect to anyone else (except those blocked by admins, more on that below), so it doesn&#39;t matter all that much which instance you join. Think of it like email: you could have a GMail address or an Outlook address or both or more than that and still exchange messages with anyone else.</p>\n\n<p><br/> <br/></p>\n\n<p>The factors to joining a given server are:</p>\n\n<p><br/> <br/></p>\n\n<p>How many people are on the server? General purpose servers may end up with more signups and have trouble staying stable when, say, a billionaire buys Twitter.</p>\n\n<p><br/> <br/></p>\n\n<p>Does the server have a topic that relates to your interests? While you can connect with anyone the folks on the same server will generally be easier to discover via trends or the server-wide &quot;local&quot; feed.</p>\n\n<p><br/> <br/></p>\n\n<p>Does it have a cool name? Look, there&#39;s nothing wrong with choosing the one that sounds the coolest.</p>\n",

Just like being a moderator is a position of trust, so is working on our infrastructure. Hang out, take part in the community, and build trust before asking for access to the servers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><hr class=\"spacer\"></p>\n\n<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>If you believe anyone is in physical danger or doing something that is against the law, please notify appropriate emergency services first by calling the relevant local authorities.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The instance is primarily meant for the PHP community and surrounding tech, but posts are not required to be on-topic.

This includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviours:<ol>\n        <li>Continuing to engage in conversation with a user that has specifically requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist, regardless of platform-specific privacy tools employed</li>\n        <li>Aggregating, posting, and/or disseminating a person's demographic, personal, or private data without express permission (informally called doxing or dropping dox)</li>\n        <li>Inciting users to engage another user in continued interaction or discussion after a user has requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist (informally called brigading or dogpiling)</li>\n    </ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These provisions notwithstanding, the administration of the service reserves the right to revoke any user's access permissions, at any time, for any reason, except as limited by law.</p>\n\n<p><hr class=\"spacer\"></p>\n\n<h2>Moderation Procedures</h2>\n\n<h3>Cross-Instance Moderation</h3>\n\n<p>First, a few notes on how cross-instance moderation works:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>If a remote user is reported from our instance, the report is immediately forwarded to the home of the remote user.</li>\n    <li>Suspension of a remote user only makes them invisible from, and unable to react to, users on our instance.</li>\n    <li>Any moderation actions we take with regard to a remote user are not relayed back to that user’s home instance.</li>\n    <li>Our view of remote users does not include any information (email, IP address, etc.) that would allow us to proactively block that user from interacting with our instance outside the context of the account they’re currently on.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>With that said, if user A on our instance reports user B on another instance for harassment/hate speech or similar-tier offences, moderators can and should take proactive action comparable to if the harassment had been directed at a user on our instance, even if the reported user has had no interactions with our instance (including follows in either direction). So if the remote user’s feed is exclusively hate speech, suspend that user.</p>\n\n<h3>Proactive vs. Reactive Moderation</h3>\n\n<p>Moderators are not obligated, as part of their role, to actively seek out accounts or posts that break our rules or would result in a report. Moderators, like any user of our instance, can use reporting functionality for bad actors that they see during their own use of the platform, and can even take moderation actions directly without going through the report system if they see something sufficiently egregious, though in those cases moderators should post in Discord with what they've done as an audit trail on top of the one built into Mastodon.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, moderators’ primary duty is to assist in resolving reports made by other users in a timely and consistent manner. This means that the role of a moderator is primarily reactive rather than proactive, and we’re knowingly making the tradeoff of catching things quickly to balance workload on a fully-volunteer moderation staff.</p>\n\n<h3>Best Practices</h3>\n\n<p>This section contains a set of guidelines on how to best use this instance. They include suggestions for when to use Content Warnings. (Mostly copied from <a href=\"https://blog.chaos.social/rules\">https://blog.chaos.social/rules</a>):</p>\n\n<p>We ask users on phpc.social to keep the following guidelines in mind, in order to foster a considerate and accessible atmosphere. Forgetting about them is not as serious as breaking the instance rules, but repeated malicious unwillingness to follow the best practices will be considered just like breaking a rule.</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Use content warnings liberally, especially for topics that are potentially disturbing or controversial, or that make life harder for people struggling with addiction or trauma, but also for spoilers.</li>\n    <li>Set the right language for your posts. By default Mastodon will use the interface language to attach to your posts, but if you (for example) have set that to English, and you post in German, then the posts will have \"English\" attached to them, and translations don’t work.</li>\n    <li>Add descriptions to images and videos.</li>\n    <li>Provide credit for creative works that are not your own.</li>\n    <li>Don't be a reply guy – uninvited comments about another user’s personal choices, lifestyle, or family are strongly discouraged and may be considered harassment.</li>\n    <li>In discussions, please remain civil, do not insult the people you’re talking to. Don’t escalate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><hr class=\"spacer\"></p>\n\n<h2>Reporting Harassment</h2>\n\n<p>To report harassment, click the three vertical dots (⋮) on a user's profile and select \"Report @user.\" For urgent concerns, you may contact us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@phpcommunity.org\">hello@phpcommunity.org</a>.</p>\n\n<p><hr class=\"spacer\"></p>\n\n<h2>Policies</h2>\n\n<p>Your continued used of <a href=\"https://phpc.social\">phpc.social</a> implies your agreement to our policies.

A number of instance blocks are implemented to comply with the principles of the covenant and to prevent our users from being exposed to content that does not comply with our instance rules.</p>\n\n<p><hr class=\"spacer\"></p>\n",

We do not require or enforce English (Moderators may use automated translation to spot-check posts for adherence to our code of conduct).\nThis server may host content that expresses sexuality, body positivity, and other adult themes. If this is of personal concern, we recommend joining another instance. (There are alternative instances, such as <a href=\"https://theblower.au\">https://theblower.au</a> that are safe for minors.)</p>\n\n<h2>Companies are not allowed</h2>\n\n<p>We do not accept companies and corporate brands here. These guidelines clarify our expectations:</p>\n\n<p><code>Joe from Joe’s Plumbing</code> is fine, <code>Joe’s Plumbing</code> is not. You may add links to a business you are connected to in your profile, just do not use your feed to regularly share ads.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a small sample of accounts we will and will not accept. These are common examples which hopefully set the tone of our instance. Please contact us if you are unsure if this applies to you, and our  team can review your request to join on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n\n<h3>Generally Not Allowed Accounts</h3>\n\n<p>We want to limit advertising, marketing, brands and promotion, while none of these are banned. In order to reach this goal, the administrator has banned a few kinds of accounts:\n-   Corporations / Businesses\n-   Retailers / Ecommerce\n-   Newspapers and News Outlets\n-   Mainstream Television Networks\n-   Marketing, Advertising and Promotion\n-   Political Parties (politicians or political figures are welcome)\n-   Lobby Groups / Astroturf fronts</p>\n\n<p>This is only for the businesses themselves. Workers of all stripes are welcome. There are other instances that welcome brands, and we’ll direct any accounts that break these guidelines to those instances.</p>\n\n<h1>Allowed</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Professionals</li>\n<li>  People with a personal brand</li>\n<li>  Politicians or Political figures</li>\n<li>  Journalists, authors, writers</li>\n<li>  Podcasts, Bands or entertainment groups</li>\n<li>  Independent artists / Musicians / Performers</li>\n<li>  Content Creators, Streamers, Youtubers</li>\n<li>  Community spaces, HackerSpaces</li>\n<li>  Social support and community organisations</li>\n<li>  NFPs / NGOs and other humanitarian groups</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Use your account to communicate and engage with the community, and don’t exclusively promote and advertise.

We will refine these rules over time.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Any NSFW / 18+ content MUST have a content warning</li>\n<li>  Registering accounts with inherently malicious intent</li>\n<li>  Unauthorised distribution of any personal information or data (DOXing)</li>\n<li>  Impersonation: You may not impersonate individuals, groups, or organisations in a manner that is intended to or does mislead, confuse, or deceive others.

Instead, you can scroll on, block, mute, or report to let moderators deal with it.</p>\n\n<p>The following types of content are explicitly disallowed and will result in revocation of access to the service:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Conduct promoting the ideology of National Socialism (Seriously. Absolutely no Nazis!)</li>\n<li>  Holocaust denial, Nazi symbolism, or similar content</li>\n<li>  White supremacy. </li>\n<li>  Violence: Do not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people. This includes, but is not limited to, threatening or promoting terrorism. Do not affiliate with organisations that — whether by their own statements or activity both on and off the platform — use or promote violence against civilians to further their causes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>-   Child exploitation: you may not post sexually suggestive or exploitive images of minors in any way (regardless of context). Example: No bath photos</h2>\n\n<h1>Content Warning (CW) and Hashtag Guidelines</h1>\n\n<p>Hashtags are heavily encouraged as the primary way for others to discover your themed content, while also allowing people to quickly filter content they do not wish to see on their feeds. Please note that hashtags must be used in the main body of a post - they do not work when used in the CW. To aid readability by humans and screen readers, please CamelCase #HashTags (capitalise the first letter of each word).</p>\n\n<p>We encourage the use of Content Warnings (aka Content Wrappers, Summaries, Topics, Subject lines) on your posts. CWs are a courtesy to your readers and other members of the Aus Social community. CWs are not self-censorship: they do not suppress the indexing of posts, only their initial visibility. Aus.Social believes that CWs are an important tool to support people&#39;s self-autonomy, but they can also be used for expression and creativity.</p>\n\n<p>Admin Note: CWs are not expected on posts made by historically and/or socially marginalised people about their own lived-experiences or activism, though authors may choose to do so.</p>\n\n<h2>Expected CWs and Hashtags</h2>\n\n<p>Everybody on Aus.Social must use Content Warnings (CWs) and hashtags for the following topics:</p>\n\n<p>Politics, including party politics, electoral politics, geopolitic, elections and general governmental drama.\nPlease use a <code>AusPol</code> CW and/or <code>#AusPol</code> Hashtag.\nSame with #USPol/#UKPol/#GeoPol etc\nAdult Content including Nudes / Lewds / NSFW posts\nPlease use a CW (and any suitable hashtags)\nAdvertising of products/brands (CW)\nPlease use a CW (and any suitable hashtags)\nDepictions of violence and gore (CW)\nPlease use a CW (and any suitable hashtags)</p>\n\n<p>If you regularly post without using CWs or Hashtags for these topics, it will be both harder for those of us looking for #AusPol, and those looking to filter them. It will very likely result in other people reporting your posts, and our moderation team will be in touch with you to ask nicely to use CWs and Hashtags.</p>\n\n<h2>Recommended CWs</h2>\n\n<p>The following is a list of topics which have been commonly used by people on Mastodon/Aus Social CWs in the past.</p>\n\n<p>A 2022 survey of public posts on the Aus Social local timeline showed that CWs had been used for the following topics. This list is advisory and intended only as a guide to the culture of Aus Social!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Religion, or Proselytising</li>\n<li>  Racism, Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and anti-Blackness</li>\n<li>  Sexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, ableism, and fatphobia</li>\n<li>  Rape, sexual harassment, bullying, psychological harassment</li>\n<li>  Violence, war, party politics, electoral politics, conspiracy theories</li>\n<li>  Climate change, environmental damage</li>\n<li>  Landlords, renting, billionaires, celebrities</li>\n<li>  Mental health, physical health</li>\n<li>  Drugs, medical, blood, gore, surgery, hospitals, doctors, diseases</li>\n<li>  Police, military, and legal</li>\n<li>  Illness, death, suicide</li>\n<li>  Food, meat, alcohol</li>\n<li>  Eye contact (any animal), selfies</li>\n<li>  Spiders and other arthropods, reptiles, and amphibians</li>\n<li>  Animal cruelty</li>\n<li>  Sports, particularly league sports</li>\n<li>  Trypophobia, strobing lights, flickering</li>\n<li>  Neurodivergence, autism, and ADHD</li>\n<li>  Gambling, addictive, and obsessive behaviours</li>\n<li>  Long posts &gt; 500 characters</li>\n<li>  Spoilers for movies/TV/books</li>\n<li>  Content that is unfriendly to screen readers such as ASCII art</li>\n<li>  Other social media platforms, large corporations</li>\n<li>  Esoteric hobbies</li>\n<li>  Excessive use of capital letters or Unicode typography\nExcessive use of emojis (as they are annoying for people using screenreaders)</li>\n<li>  Excessive, or aggressive use of profanity</li>\n<li>  Jokes where you tap to see the punchline</li>\n<li>  Also often metadiscussions of the above.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Our Responsibilities</h1>\n\n<p>The administrator and moderators will endeavour to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Keep the atmosphere of the server as welcoming and enjoyable as possible.</li>\n<li>  Keep this server online and functional for as long as possible.</li>\n<li>  Clarify the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We will not act on complaints regarding:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Criticising racist, sexist, or otherwise oppressive behaviour or assumptions.</li>\n<li>  Good faith and non-malicious conduct whose object is to ameliorate (improve) the conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups.</li>\n<li>  Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as &quot;leave me alone,&quot; &quot;go away,&quot; or &quot;I’m not discussing this with you&quot;.</li>\n<li>  Swearing or profanity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Admin note: People are going to fight on the internet (this is a communication platform), and we generally try to ask people to block/mute people and take control of their social network experience as much as possible for situations where escalating to the moderation team via a report is not required... for issues that don&#39;t break any rules, but are still of concern to those involved (in or out of the fighting), Our moderation team might refuse to act as a mediator, but they will respond when (lines are crossed or) rules are broken.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Moderator code of conduct</h1>\n\n<p>Aus Social has a number of users who are also designated moderators.

So in order for your account to be considered, please ensure to write something about why you think Ruby.social is the right instance for you. If you just want a Mastodon account, you should probably sign up at one of the larger instances instead.</p>\n\n<p>This Mastodon instance is for people interested in <em>Ruby</em>, <em>Rails</em>, and <em>Ruby-related topics</em>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.xyz/@jmcharnes/100606321863664252\" title=\"You didn't quite make the 25 new members, but we like the joke anyway\">AKA #matztodon 😄</a></p>\n\n<p>For anyone who's interested in or working with Ruby, or related technologies. We want to be a <em>friendly community of communities</em>, discovering new people and welcoming them into the happiness that is programming with Ruby :-)</p>\n\n<p>Discussions don't need to be about Ruby, but you'll get more out of this instance if that's one of your interests.</p>\n\n<p>We take a strong stance against spam, and are moderating all signups. We are not anti-company or anti-promotion, but either applies to you, you will need to demonstrate your relevance to the community.

If this is not okay with you, this might not be the instance for you.</p>\n\n<p>Also, for truly private data sent between two people, Mastodon offers no E2E encryption. So use Signal or WhatsApp for the things you really want to be private.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"discussion-and-feedback\">Discussion and Feedback</h2>\n\n<p>For questions about policy, bots, design, theming, etc., please refer to our <a href=\"https://github.com/ruby-social/issues/issues\">discussions GitHub repo</a>.</p>\n",

Mastodon &egrave; un'alternativa gratuita alle piattaforme social come Facebook e Twitter.<br />Su Mastodon i messaggi si chiamano \"Toot\" (&egrave; il verso dell'elefantino, simbolo del social) ed in questa istanza &egrave; prevista la lunghezza massima standard di 500 caratteri per ogni toot.<br />I toot possono avere quattro livelli di privacy, liberamente selezionabili dall'utente:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"bullet\">\n<li>pubblico (pubblicato in timeline pubblica)</li>\n<li>pubblico ma non pubblicato nella timeline pubblica</li>\n<li>visibile solo ai followers</li>\n<li>messaggio privato visibile sono ai destinatari menzionati</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I toot pubblici potrebbero essere indicizzati sui motori di ricerca. Un \"Boost\" &egrave; l'azione con cui si ridiffonde un toot altrui.<br />I messaggi privati, ovvero i toot leggibili soltanto dagli utenti menzionati, sono conservati in chiaro nel database del sistema; quindi, mentre la loro trasmissione avviene sul web con la protezione del protocollo SSL, essi sono leggibili in chiaro da chi abbia accesso al database.<br />La \"Timeline locale\" presenta i toot dell'istanza Mastodon.uno in ordine cronologico (non ci sono algoritmi che ti suggeriscono contenuti particolari ed ogni toot ha la stessa probabilit&agrave; di essere visto).<br />La \"Timeline federata\" presenta i toot provenienti da molte altre istanze, italiane o internazionali, federate con Mastodon.uno. Non sono presenti tutti i toot di tutte le istanze possibili, nessuna istanza federa veramente tutte le altre.<br />Twitter &egrave; conosciuto come \"Birdsite\".<br />Mastodon permette di formare una rete di nodi collegati tra loro (chiamati \"istanze\") che dialogano fra loro con il protocollo ActivityPub.&nbsp;<br />Mastodon fa parte del network del Fediverso, permettendo ai suoi utenti di sfruttare la struttura federata per interagire anche con utenti su diverse piattaforme aperte che supportano lo stesso protocollo, come PeerTube e Friendica. A differenza dei social commerciali, non c'&egrave; un solo server centrale per Mastodon: ogni istanza ha proprie regole, policy di moderazione, lingua e argomenti preferiti di discussione. E' bene che gli utenti si scelgano l'istanza pi&ugrave; affine alla propria sensibilit&agrave; ed interessi. E' sempre possibile migrare il proprio profilo presso un'altra istanza senza perdere contenuti e followers.<br />Mentre ogni singola istanza &egrave; caratterizzata da una policy che regolamenta in modo specifico la tipologia di contenuti ammessi, il Fediverso, in quanto formato dall'interazione fra istanze federate, &egrave; nel suo complesso pluralista.<br />Per approfondire il funzionamento di Mastodon, &egrave; possibile consultare la guida gratuita in italiano <u>mastodon.it</u>.</p>\n\n<h2>Quando nasce Mastodon?</h2>\n\n<p>Mastodon nasce nel 2016 in Germania per iniziativa del ventiquattrenne Eugen Rochko, per ovviare ai limiti dei social network centralizzati come Twitter ed evitare il rischio che una singola azienda monopolizzi le comunicazioni.<br />L'istanza italiana con un dominio dedicato Mastodon.uno nasce nel 2018 ed entra a far parte della federazione internazionale rappresentando gli utenti di Lingua Italiana. <span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">Mastodon.uno &egrave; un'istanza italiana autogestita ed autofinanziata in Italia, non &egrave; una societ&agrave; e non fa data mining (raccolta, elaborazione e vendita di informazioni personali), siamo presenti su Twitter e su Noblogo.</span> <br /><br /></p>\n\n<h2>Perch&eacute; Mastodon?</h2>\n\n<p><em>Affermare che non si &egrave; interessati al diritto alla privacy perch&eacute; non si ha nulla da nascondere &egrave; come dire che non si &egrave; interessati alla libert&agrave; di parola perch&eacute; non si ha nulla da dire</em>. (Edward Snowden)<br /><span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">Il web &egrave; relegato in giardini recintati e gigantesche server farm che sono nelle mani di poche giganti aziende tecnologiche. I nostri post finiscono nelle bacheche di Facebook e Twitter, soggiogati dai termini di servizio che queste aziende americane impongono. Le foto e i video finiscono su piattaforme come Instagram, Snapchat e YouTube, atolli digitali completamente isolati l&rsquo;uno dall&rsquo;altro. Tutte queste grandi aziende sono impegnate nell'estrarre valore dai nostri contenuti, nel profilarci nel modo pi&ugrave; preciso possibile, in modo tale da influenzare i nostri comportamenti di acquisto, le nostre preferenze politiche, la nostra percezione della realt&agrave;, solo in funzione della <em>loro</em> crescita economica.</span><br /><span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">I social commerciali quindi offrono i loro servizi gratuitamente ma traggono profitti dalla profilazione dei gusti e delle preferenze degli utenti. Questo viene chiamato il \"Capitalismo della sorveglianza\" e la sua accettazione da parte del pubblico attraverso l'argomentazione \"non ho nulla da nascondere\" &egrave; stata ben descritta nel documentario \"Nothing To Hide\".&nbsp;</span><br />Nel documentario<span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">\"The Social Dilemma\" viene ben illustrato come l'utilizzo improprio e incontrollato di questi dati porti a un aumento della dipendenza dai social, manipolazione psicologica, formazione di una filter bubble, l'alimentazione della disinformazione.</span><br /><span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">Questa enorme mole di dati pu&ograve; essere messa a disposizione anche di governi (come &egrave; accaduto con lo scandalo di Cambridge Analytica) per orientare facilmente opinioni e comportamenti.</span><br /><span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">Mastodon &egrave; una alternativa open source e free alle piattaforme social come facebook e twitter, una federazione di istanze aperta e decentralizzata chiamata Fediverso.</span><br /><span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">Il Fediverso &egrave; la comunit&agrave; delle community, privo di pubblicit&agrave; e di scopi di lucro, privo di algoritmi di profilazione e modifica comportamentale.

Vogliamo essere una community <span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">felice e gentile, ma anche competente e divertente</span>. Per questo ci siamo dati una <strong>policy rispettosa dei dritti di tutti</strong>, per costruire insieme una community sana e priva di <span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">comportamenti tossici</span>.<br />Ti consigliamo di leggere questa policy e il <a href=\"https://mastodon.uno/about/more\"><u>manifesto dell'istanza</u></a> per capire se Mastodon.uno &egrave; il server che fa per te. Se non ti riconosci o non condividi le regole di questa istanza puoi cercarne un'altra che rispecchi di pi&ugrave; la tua sensibilit&agrave; o i tuoi interessi. In alternativa puoi sempre creare la tua istanza (questo &egrave; il bello di Mastodon) e rimanere collegato all'interno della federazione.<br />Mastodon.uno vuole rimanere sempre un luogo di incontro, dialogo e confronto con tutti coloro che vorranno apportare contributi rispettando il regolamento dell'istanza.<br /><br /><strong><span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">Netiquette</span></strong><br />Iscriversi in Mastodon.uno significa entrare in una comunit&agrave; dinamica e attiva, valgono per prima cose le regola della buona educazione, dell'ascolto e del rispetto degli utenti presenti. &Egrave; apprezzata la presentazione dei nuovi arrivati.<br />Si raccomanda di segnalare sempre i contenuti che potrebbero mettere in imbarazzo altri utenti con l'<strong>etichetta NSFW</strong> (Not Suitable For Work, non adatto al lavoro) e nascondere il contenuto del toot attivando la <strong>funzione CW</strong> (Content Warning). Si tratta di avvertire gli altri utenti che il contenuto che stanno per visualizzare non &egrave; sempre adatto in tutti i contesti o a tutte le persone.<br />E' buona prassi nascondere il proprio toot con un CW (Content Warning) e un avviso tutto in maiuscolo \"SPOILER ALERT\" quando si sta per fare uno spoiler in modo da avvertire il lettore di proseguire a suo rischio e pericolo. Commettiamo uno spoiler nel momento in cui sveliamo particolari importanti riguardanti un contenuto, per lo pi&ugrave; narrativo, rivelando anticipazioni, svelando colpi di scena o eventi importanti. Pertanto, &egrave; necessario attendere un ragionevole lasso di tempo prima di lasciarsi andare a commenti che potrebbero rovinare la fruizione dei contenuti ad altri utenti. Insomma non pu&ograve; essere considerato spoiler dire che <span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">Renzo e Lucia</span> alla fine si sposano.<br />Quando si desidera mandare a contenuti esterni, preferire ai link Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, i corrispondenti frontend Open come Nitter, Invidious, Bibliogram,Teddit<em>.</em><br /><br /><strong><span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">Linguaggio offensivo e contenuti censurabili</span></strong><br />Mastodon Uno &egrave; una comunit&agrave; in cui ci si diverte e ci si rispetta. La libert&agrave; di espressione &egrave; fondamentale in un web minacciato sempre di pi&ugrave; dalle censure algoritmiche dei social commerciali.<span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\"> Siamo a favore della libert&agrave; di espressione, attraverso il rispetto della sensibilit&agrave; di tutti. Non siamo tuttavia tolleranti verso chi abusa dell'anonimato.</span> Pertanto, alcuni comportamenti sono vietati in modo assoluto. Su questa istanza:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"bullet\">\n<li>&egrave; vietata qualsiasi forma di razzismo, sessismo, transfobia, misoginia</li>\n<li>&egrave; vietato esprimere o fomentare pregiudizi oppure odio nei confronti di gruppi sociali o etnici</li>\n<li>&egrave; vietata qualsiasi forma di intolleranza religiosa</li>\n<li>sono vietate foto/video sessualmente esplicite, oppure pornografiche (le foto o rappresentazioni grafiche/artistiche di nudo sono consentite solo con la dicitura NSFW e la protezione CW, Content Warning, attivata)</li>\n<li><span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">sono vietate le foto/video o rappresentazioni grafiche/artistiche di nudo, oppure sessualmente esplicite, oppure pornografiche che coinvolgano minori</span></li>\n<li><span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">sono vietati contenuti che promuovano un qualsiasi forma fascismo, neofascismo, nazismo, neonazismo, estrema destra, alt-right, negazione dell'Olocausto, anche sotto le mentite spoglie della libert&agrave; di parola</span></li>\n<li><span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">sono vietati foto/video o rappresentazioni grafiche/artistiche che ritraggano violenza estrema</span></li>\n<li><span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">sono vietati i contenuti pro-ana (promozione di comportamenti legati al disturbo alimentare dell'anoressia nervosa) oppure pro-mia (promozione di comportamenti legati al disturbo alimentare della bulimia nervosa)</span></li>\n<li>&egrave; vietato il trolling (provocare e disturbare deliberatamente altri utenti)</li>\n<li>&egrave; vietato <span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">offendere, insultare, diffamare o minacciare qualunque persona</span></li>\n<li>&egrave; vietata qualsiasi forma di istigazione alla violenza o a commettere reati; &egrave; ugualmente vietata qualsiasi forma di utilizzo dell'istanza Mastodon.uno ai fini di commettere reati. Nel malaugurato caso di reato commesso utilizzando in qualunque forma il server di Mastodon.uno, gli amministratori si comporteranno sulla base delle Leggi vigenti in Italia</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br /><strong>Account di propaganda partitica e promozione di pratiche religiose, spirituali, pastorali e ascetiche</strong><br />\nMastodon.uno è una community apartititica, laica, aconfessionale e senza scopo di lucro.\n<br />\nAccount con finalità di propaganda partitica (come sezioni di partito, movimenti, liste elettorali) o account religiosi, spirituali ed ascetici non possono essere ospitati.\n<br />\nQuesti account saranno invitati a spostarsi su un&#39;altra istanza da dove potranno essere seguiti.</p>\n\n<p><br /><strong>Fake news e disinformazione</strong><br />Fake news e disinformazione sono problemi sempre pi&ugrave; presenti sul web. Le persone, sempre pi&ugrave; sfiduciate nei confronti di istituzioni e informazione condotta dal giornalismo professionale, scosse dalla discrepanza tra realt&agrave; quotidianamente vissuta e grandi annunci dei media, si sono rifugiate nel buco nero delle teorie paranoidi e spiegazioni cospirazioniste. Questa lettura della realt&agrave;, forse adottata in buona fede e con funzione consolatoria, rischia talvolta di avere conseguenze concrete nella vita o sulla sicurezza delle persone. D'altra parte, le persone rischiano di farsi strumentalizzare per finalit&agrave; politiche o di potere che vanno al dil&agrave; dei contenuti che di volta in volta vengono discussi. Inoltre questo fenomeno ha dato il via alla legittimazione delle velleit&agrave; di censura sul web da parte di isitituzioni governative o statali delle opinioni legittimamente dissonanti, con il pretesto della tutela dei cittadini dalle fake news.<br />Come scovare la disinformazione o la cattiva informazione? E' molto difficile, le falsit&agrave; sono spesso cos&igrave; verosimili o ben congegnate da indurre in errore anche i pi&ugrave; esperti e smaliziati, giornalisti inclusi. Le fake news si diffondono molto velocemente (si calcola che vengano condivise 6 volte pi&ugrave; velocemente delle notizie vere) anche a causa dell'analfabetsismo digitale, ovvero l'impreparazione delle persone nel fronteggiare questo fenomeno. Il giornalismo professionale di questi ultimi anni non si &egrave; rivelato un antidoto contro le frottole, ma una parte del problema, dato che, inseguendo i ritmi dei social network, ingigantisce presunte notizie senza alcun processo di verifica preventiva, per non parlare della propaganda deliberata.<br />In questa istanza non sono ben accetti utenti principalmente impegnati in tutte quelle attivit&agrave; che hanno l'effetto (desiderato o meno) di mettere in discussione in modo fuorviante e aneddotico comportamenti e/o fatti assodati. Ad esempio non sono ben accetti: diffusione di verit&agrave; dubbie o alternative, falsit&agrave;, prove aneddotiche, false citazioni, false conferme o citazioni circolari, contenuti che provocano shock, teorie cospirative, trame oscure, disinformazione, sensazionalismo, propaganda, dicerie, bufale, leggende urbane, pseudoscienza.<br />E' una regola basilare quella di non pubblicare contenuti inesatti, imprecisi o falsi. Quando si condivide un'informazione &egrave; importante essere certi del grado di veridicit&agrave; ed &egrave; buona norma citare la fonte della notizia. Il fenomeno delle bufale trova infatti il suo ossigeno proprio nella condivisione selvaggia di una notizia priva di fondamento da parte di utenti che si lasciano colpire emotivamente senza farsi troppe domande, oppure sono troppo pigri per verificare, anche solo cercando velocemente sui motori di ricerca.<br /><br /><strong>Account verificati</strong><br />La promozione di contenuti creati dall'utente e l'uso di mastodon a scopi autopromozionali non commerciali &egrave; consentita solo per i contenuti appartenenti all'utente, mentre &egrave; vietato promuovere contenuti di terze parti. Per assicurare la promozione di contenuti propri &egrave; necessario effettuare la verifica dell'account.<br />Per verificare il proprio account, &egrave; sufficiente inserire lo script (che si trova nel proprio pannello di modifica del profilo utente - Profilo &gt; Modifica profilo &gt; Verifica) all'interno della home page del proprio sito web. <span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">In alternativa, &egrave; possibile verificare il proprio account con la app open source <strong>keybase</strong> per verificare la propria identit&agrave; su pi&ugrave; social: keybase su Mastodon.uno. Invitiamo tutti quindi a verificare il proprio account personale con il proprio sito web.</span><br />L'uso di bot &egrave; consentito, ma &egrave; necessario impostare l'account come bot ed essere verificati. E' possibile inserire link per chiedere donazioni solo da account verificati.&nbsp;<br />&Egrave; apprezzato da parte della comunit&agrave; che l'utente intenzionato a promuovere un proprio spazio partecipi attivamente alle attivit&agrave; di Mastodon.uno.<br /><br /><strong>Spam e flooding</strong><br />Sono vietati spamming (invio di messaggi pubblicitari) e flooding (invio di grande quantit&agrave; di messaggi), la creazione di account multipli da parte della stessa persona, topic e/o <span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">risposte multiple sullo stesso argomento</span>.<br /><br /><strong>Paywall, promo servizi a pagamento e link di affiliazione</strong><br />&Egrave; vietato postare link a siti che richiedano la registrazione o il pagamento per accedere ai contenuti.<br />&Egrave; vietato postare link a pagine che propongono prodotti o servizi a pagamento.<br />&Egrave; vietato postare link contenenti codice di affiliazione (referral link o revenue link), ovvero quei link che tracciano il comportamento dell'utente ricompensando con un bonus chi a pubblicato il link.<br />E' vietato postare contenuti che promuovono il gioco d'azzardo, scommesse o giochi con denaro in genere.<br /><br /><strong>Et&agrave; minima per l'iscrizione</strong><br />Iscrivendoti all'istanza Mastodon.uno, dichiari <span data-comment=\"comment-deleted\">di aver compiuto almeno i <strong>16 anni di et&agrave;</strong></span>.<br /><br /><strong>Privacy nei contenuti postati</strong><br />&Egrave; vietato postare informazioni personali, screenshot di conversazioni private o link a pagine personali su altri social network: l'anonimato degli utenti e delle persone va rispettato.<br /><br /><strong>Moderazione dei contenuti</strong><br />I moderatori dell'istanza, in caso di violazione della policy dell'istanza, si riservano di:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"bullet\">\n<li>entrare nel merito della discussione contestando uno o pi&ugrave; aspetti delle argomentazioni o richiedendo spiegazioni, non diversamente da quanto pu&ograve; fare qualsiasi utente non moderatore (tanto dissenso significa che l'istanza non apprezza)</li>\n<li>avvertire esplicitamente un utente con un messaggio pubblico oppure privato, specificando la violazione di policy e la richiesta dei moderatori (come ad esempio: cancellare un toot, cambiare la modalit&agrave; o i contenuti futuri, invito a trasferirsi su una istanza pi&ugrave; idonea ai contenuti/metodo dell'utente)</li>\n<li>in caso di mancata risposta o interlocuzione con i moderatori, un utente pu&ograve; venire silenziato, misura che non lo far&agrave; pi&ugrave; apparire in timeline pubblica</li>\n<li>in caso continue violazioni della policy e mancata risposta o interlocuzione con i moderatori, un utente pu&ograve; essere bloccato, misura che ne cancella tutti i contenuti e l'account senza possibilit&agrave; di recupero</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br /><strong>Risoluzione delle controversie</strong><br />In caso di disaccordo in relazione all'intervento di un moderatore, l'utente pu&ograve; sottoporre le sue ragioni agli amministratori del sistema: @filippodb e @devol. Il giudizio degli amministratori &egrave; definitivo e inappellabile. In caso di controversie, &egrave; bene tuttavia che gli utenti considerino il fatto che c'&egrave; sempre la possibilit&agrave; di scegliere un'istanza pi&ugrave; affine alla propria sensibilit&agrave; ed interessi. E' sempre possibile migrare il proprio profilo presso un'altra istanza senza perdere contenuti e followers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

If you want to join, holler!</p>\n\n<h3><font size=\"6.5\">DONATIONS</font></h3>\n\n<p>The usage of the server is free and will always remain free, unless something completely unforeseen happens (it won&#39;t!).<br>\nBut the server costs money, which Paula pays out of her own pocket.\nTo support her please donate to:</p>\n\n<p>Name: PaulaToThePeople<br>\nIBAN: DE16 4306 0967 8229 4427 00<br>\nBic: GENODEM1GLS</p>\n\n<h3><font size=\"6.5\">PRINCIPLES</font></h3>\n\n<h3><font size=\"4\">We stand for climate justice, which includes justice for all marginalized people as well as other living beings and we stand against discrimination and exploitation.</font></h3>\n\n<p>We are allies to disabled people, queer and lgbtqia* people, BIPoC, women, poor people, kids and future generations as well as other vulnerable groups including animals, plants and all living beings. We might be critical to religion in general, but stand up against antisemitism, islamomisia and other forms of discrimination due to religious background.\nWe acknowledge our own privileges and work on our own unintentionally discriminatory behaviors. We are all part of an exploitative system and it&#39;s impossible to live within that system without harming anyone. We are aware of that and try to work against it, but we are not all fossil free and vegan and that&#39;s okay. We don&#39;t exclusively post about climate justice, but at least some of our posts should be about climate justice.</p>\n\n<h3><font size=\"4\">We consider ourselves on the left side of the political spectrum and stand up against right wing ideologies.</font></h3>\n\n<p>We have different political views, but are all on the left side or at least are left-open, but right-closed centrists. We stand together against capitalism and fascism and even if we disagree on important issues we don&#39;t loose sight of our common goals.</p>\n\n<h3><font size=\"4\">We believe the Fediverse should be a place for respectful discourse and we stand against harassment, trolling and spam.</font></h3>\n\n<p>Everybody&#39;s boundaries are to be respected.</p>\n\n<h3><font size=\"4\">We stand up for peace and against violence, oppression and authoritarianism.</font></h3>\n\n<p>We are pacifists, but acknowledge that when attacked, people have the right to defend themselves following international law.\nWe may be critical of states in general, but we never deny any country their statehood.\nWe condemn violence against innocent people and always show solidarity with victims of violence. We don&#39;t promote violence in protest, but peaceful sabotage against oppressors is not violence.</p>\n\n<h3><font size=\"4\">We stand behind the science and against fake-news & propaganda.</font></h3>\n\n<p>We are not all scientists ourselves and experts in every field we post about, but we try not to spread any false information.

On the one hand, we do not want to make too many hard-and-fast rules. We are anarchists, and therefore, we do not care to think too long about how to govern every aspect of how other people should behave. On the other hand, don't want our collective resources to be used to spread ideas that go against our values. To this end, we have come up with the following guidelines. We plan on adapting and changing these guidelines over time, and are open to feedback, critique, and suggestions from other Mastodon users, moderators and administrators.<br/>\n\nAs a user of this platform, please be mindful that your username ends with @kolektiva.social and your actions, in part, represent the instance. Your engagement builds an expression, and the values you share reverberate from within and outside this digital neighbourhood.\n\n<h2>WHAT YOU SHOULDN'T POST AT ALL:</h2>\nPosts containing the following content will be removed, and users will have their accounts immediately suspended and/or deleted.<br/>\n\n<ul><li>Racist, misogynistic, transphobic, homophobic, ableist slurs, or other derogatory pejoratives for oppressed identity groups (unless you belong to that group and are reclaiming the term)</li>\n<li>Blatantly racist, casteist, ableist, sexist, transphobic, or otherwise chauvinistic and bigoted discourse</li>\n<li>Symbols and slogans associated with fascist regimes and/or fascist, third-positionist, western chauvinist or white nationalist movements</li>\n<li>Arguments that seek to deny or cast doubt on historic or ongoing acts of genocide</li>\n<li>Pornographic and/or sexualized images depicting people who did not consent to their image being shared</li>\n<li>Pedophilia/MAP content, in all its manifestations</li>\n<li>Purposeful misinformation</li>\n<li>Spam</li></ul>\n\n<h2>WHAT YOU SHOULDN'T <i>REALLY</i> POST:</h2>\n\n<p>Kolektiva.social is an anarchist/anti-colonial instance. Posts containing the following content may be reported and/or removed, and the user may be issued a warning. Repeated warnings may lead to accounts being suspended, and/or their users being encouraged to migrate their account to another instance.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Propaganda from politicians or political parties that seek to win elections</li>\n<li>Propaganda from the USSR, CCP, or DPRK</li>\n<li>Glorification of nation states and/or militarism</li>\n<li>Messages promoting capitalism or meritocracy</li>\n<li>Messages promoting or encouraging pseudoscience, conspiracism, or breaks with reality</li>\n<li>Targeted harassment (i.e. evading blocks, repeated hostile replies, or posts intended to instigate brigading/dogpiling against a user or another instance), even for righteous reasons</li>\n<li> Posts that could bring avoidable legal repression down upon Kolektiva's admins and/or server infrastructure (i.e. doxxing individuals paired with explicit calls for violence or threats against them)</li>\n<li>Religious proselytizing/recruitment</li>\n\n<h2>POSTS THAT SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED WITH A CONTENT WARNING:</h2>\nWe have neither the capacity nor the slightest interest in monitoring all content posted on Kolektiva.social, nor do we enjoy making judgments about what is, or is not, acceptable speech. For this reason, we encourage people to use Mastodon's built-in Content Warning (CW) tool to label posts that other users may find upsetting. Unlabeled posts that are reported to us as containing the following content will have a Content Warning added to them, and the user will be notified.\n\n<br><br>\n\nAccounts that regularly post the following types of posts without Content Warnings may have their accounts silenced, or suspended, based on the severity of the behavior, and may be asked by the moderators to migrate to another instance.<br>\n\n<ul><li>Any visual depiction of nudity</li>\n<li>Any visual depiction of blood, severe injuries, torture, murder, or medical procedures</li>\n<li>Any unambiguous visual depictions of drug use or drug paraphernalia</li>\n<li>Any message detailing sexual acts</li>\n<li>Any message mentioning suicide, self-harm, abuse, rape, or sexual assault that does not relate to a current issue</li>\n<li>Spoilers (within reason)</li></ul>\n\n<p>Apart from what is itemized above, we do not have specific guidelines for Content Warnings. All users are encouraged to be considerate of others’ needs and preferences, particularly with respect to things that are widely considered repulsive or distressing (for example, the worst events in human history and the worst things that people can do to each other).<br><br></p>\n\n<p>We explicitly do not, and never will, require users to tag political content and news-related posts.</p>\n\n<p><h3>Special Cases Worth Extra Explanation:</h3><br>\n<strong>Nudity, sex, drugs, and drug paraphernalia.</strong> We want Kolektiva.social to be as accessible as possible to minors, incarcerated people, and others whose internet access is monitored. These subjects, when visible on the public timeline, may lead to authorities speedily and irreversibly blacklisting our website in a way that political content may not. For this reason, and some others, we ask that all images depicting these subjects be accompanied with a Content Warning.<br><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>The COVID-19 pandemic.</strong> COVID-19 is a real disease, and vaccines and masks are useful measures for impeding its spread. We will treat messages to the contrary as either &quot;Purposeful misinformation&quot; or &quot;Messages promoting or encouraging pseudoscience, conspiracism, or breaks with reality&quot; as itemized earlier. It&#39;s not that we think various  &quot;experts&quot;, on health subjects or others, are entirely beyond questioning. It&#39;s simply that we also disdain our platform being used to spread health myths that are, by and large, generated and boosted in the same parts of the internet as far right conspiracy theories about the present order.<br><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Russo-Ukrainian War.</strong> We do not want our instance flooded with pro-war propaganda. We will not censor discussion of the Ukrainian far right or other problems in Ukrainian society, but we may consider gross exaggerations of these problems as propaganda aimed at providing rhetorical cover for the Russian state&#39;s imperialist aggression. We may view links to Russian state-affiliated media as &quot;purposeful misinformation&quot; or &quot;messages promoting or encouraging pseudoscience, conspiracism, or breaks with reality&quot; as itemized earlier. We may also view posts supporting NATO and/or Ukrainian nationalism as &quot;messages glorifying the nation state and/or militarism&quot;.<br><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>Analogizing Israel and Nazi Germany.</strong> We support the self-determination of the Palestinian people as well as the destruction of the ethnonationalist Israeli state, alongside all states, and we are glad to host content celebrating Palestinians&#39; anti-colonial struggle and denouncing Israeli atrocities. Rhetoric comparing Israelis and/or Zionists to the historic German Nazis, however, is as unnecessary and unhelpful as it is insulting to Jews, including anti-Zionist Jewish comrades. We consider it a form of &quot;chauvinistic and bigoted discourse&quot; as itemized earlier.<br><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>Astrology.</strong> We don’t believe in it but it’s fine.<br><br></p>\n\n<h1>USING KOLEKTIVA.SOCIAL</h1>\n\n<h2>BLOCKING AND MUTING</h2>\n\n<p>We encourage users to make use of the block and mute options to help control what content appears on their timelines. While moderators will do our best to block bad offenders and defederate from toxic instances, we recognize that people have different limits and expectations of the fediverse, and these options allow for a more personalized experience. Evading blocks and mutes is not part of respectful engagement, and may lead to suspension and deleting of accounts, and a permanent ban from Kolektiva.social.</p>\n\n<p>Instructions on how to use personalized Block and Mute controls can be found <a href=\"https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>REPORTING</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike centralized and corporate social media platforms, the process of moderation on Kolektiva.social is intended to be accountable. The users who make up the moderation team are listed publicly for this reason. We want to receive reports regarding all forms of unacceptable behavior (that we can reasonably respond to), and we will do our best to follow up within a reasonable time frame.</p>\n\n<p>Instructions on how to report a post can be found <a href=\"https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>NOTES ON REPORTING</h2>\n\n<ul><li>Reports made by users on other fediverse instances about Kolektiva.social users are anonymous. For example, if @example@mastodon.online reports a Kolektiva.social user, we will see that a user from <a href=\"https://mastodon.online/about/more/\">Mastodon.online</a> has sent a report, but not their username. We cannot respond to users about their reports if we do not know who they are. We always know which Kolektiva.social users have issued which reports, however.</li>\n<li>Reports without explanations are significantly harder to follow up on. Links, explanations, and other information are encouraged and appreciated. Furthermore, we cannot reasonably take actions against users when there is no proof of bad behavior or ill intent. Please include examples and/or reasons in your reports.</li>\n<li>A report does not guarantee the moderation response that you've requested. If reporting users are not satisfied with our decisions, we suggest using the Mute or Block functions.</li></ul>\n\n<h2>ACCESSIBILITY</h2>\n\n<p>We encourage the usage of captions and descriptive text when posting images, in order to make your posts more accessible to users who use screen readers. For the same reason, we also discourage the usage of excessive emojis or unicode text symbols in posts or usernames.<br><br></p>\n\n<p>Our instance is open to users of any language. The most commonly spoken language among Kolektiva.social mods and admins is English, but we can also communicate in French, Haitian Creole, Portuguese and Spanish. Unfortunately, members of our moderation team won’t be able to effectively communicate in other languages apart from those listed above.<br><br></p>\n\n<p>If contacted by users speaking other languages, we may seek out help from other Kolektiva.social users or the admins and mods of other instances. Barring that, we may make use of online translation software.</p>\n\n<h2>SAFETY AND DANGER ON THE FEDIVERSE</h2>\n\n<p>The Kolektiva.social moderation team is made up of relative newcomers to the fediverse, but we understand that all of the problems associated with other online spaces are also present here. Some of these problems relate to surveillance by institutions that aim for social control, and some relate to the forms of oppressive and anti-social behavior that permeate broader society. Most of the members of our collective are anarchists who have been involved in social movements for years. That is to say, we understand a few things about how repression works. We also know how and why anarchists get into fights with one another, because we have been in a few fights ourselves. At the same time, there’s lots that we don’t know.<br><br></p>\n\n<p>As a group, we can draw on a pretty wide array of experiences, but some problems around technical security are simply very complicated, and the same is true of some of the controversies that unfold in local scenes, or over the Internet in general. We will do our best to address issues as they come up. But because we are real people who live in this constantly changing world, we are likely to make mistakes. We also simply won&#39;t be able to satisfy all the (sometimes competing) requests and reports that we receive from users.<br><br></p>\n\n<p>We believe that it is imperative that anarchists and social movements abandon surveillance capitalist platforms. In fact, we think everyone on Earth should abandon these services. Platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter spy on us, hand our personal data over to hostile forces, and help to poison political discourse through monetized algorithms and the spread of reactionary ideologies. We want Kolektiva.social to be able to serve as a landing pad for people who are new to Mastodon, the fediverse, etc. For this reason, we are intentionally set up as a large, welcoming instance with open registrations. We have no interest in hosting fascists or other annoying and miserable people (and will ban them once we have a good reason to do so), but obviously some of the people on this platform may be ruder, rougher, and less sensitive than those found on smaller, more community-focused Mastodon/Hometown instances. When we talk about a mass exodus from corporate social media, we recognize that this will involve all sorts of people, and not just those who we already agree with. To paraphrase Maurice Moe Mitchell: we have a low bar to entry and a high standard for conduct.<br><br></p>\n\n<p>We want to allow people to learn how they want to conduct themselves before removing them. That said, even though we intend to be open and welcoming, we will not allow arguments around &quot;free speech&quot; to serve as cover for harmful, entitled, and/or obnoxious behavior. We are aware of the broad conversations taking place around anti-Blackness and other forms of racism on the fediverse, and we take this seriously.<br><br></p>\n\n<p>While we see it as important to provide a space where users can be themselves and reach out to others as they wish, repeatedly posting unsolicited opinions on other people&#39;s posts, playing “devil&#39;s advocate” with strangers, and other similar forms of obnoxious behavior have their limit, before they become a pattern. If you are having problems with a specific user, please feel free to reach out to one of our moderators for help with explaining microaggressions and subtly oppressive behaviors.</p>\n\n<h2>DEFEDERATING FROM OTHER INSTANCES</h2>\n\n<p>We will do our best to remain defederated from the most toxic parts of the fediverse, and will attempt to keep up-to-date on collective initiatives such as <a href=\"https://kolektiva.social/tags/fediblock\">#fediblock</a>. But to maintain Kolektiva.social&apos;s usefulness as a communications tool and social media platform, we don’t intend to defederate from large instances based on the actions of a small minority of their membership. We also don’t want to turn defederation into our activism.<br><br></p>\n\n<p>Given Kolektiva.social’s relatively large size on the fediverse (and especially in the “anarchist neighborhood”), we recognize that any decisions that we take to defederate from a given instance can severely limit that instance’s users’ ability to learn about, and engage with, various worthwhile sorts of information that Kolektiva.social users are putting onto the fediverse. Because of this, we will rely more heavily on suspending and silencing individual accounts, unless the instance itself is irredeemable. We will do our best to maintain open lines of communications with other admins, and to pass on reports about their users where we deem it necessary/appropriate.<br><br></p>\n\n<h2>A NOTE ON DECENTRALIZATION</h2>\n\n<p>We are aware of the criticism of large centralized Mastodon instances, and the arguments for a more decentralized network of smaller Mastodon servers. We are sympathetic to these criticisms for a number of reasons, not least of which being that they often come from our fellow anarchists. We encourage our users to find another instance that they find fits their expectations and views, or barring that, to create their own.<br><br></p>\n\n<p>That said, we also see a need for large instances with open registration that can serve as landing pads for those escaping from corporate social media platforms. This is a role that we see Kolektiva.social filling as we move forward with our short-term goals. We will continue to assess our role in the fediverse moving forward, and are open to dialogue with other groups about what this can and should look like. As noted earlier, we plan on producing a series of resources aimed at helping people set up and manage their own Mastodon instances.</p>\n\n<h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF KOLEKTIVA</h2>\n\n<p>Kolektiva was launched in June of 2020 by anarchist media collectives Antimídia and subMedia with the aim of developing autonomous, digital communication infrastructure for the movements we support and participate in. It soon expanded into an informal organization with members based in a handful of places all around the world. Kolektiva&apos;s first project was a PeerTube instance, <a href=\"https://kolektiva.media/\">Kolektiva.media</a>.<br><br></p>\n\n<p>Its purpose was to offer a free, non-corporate platform for anarchists and anti-colonial content producers looking to bypass Google, Facebook, and other surveillance capitalist firms, as well as censorship mandated and enforced by governments. When Facebook began purging a number of pages associated with anarchist and antifascist projects in July 2020, Kolektiva set up a Mastodon instance, <a href=\"https://kolektiva.social/\">Kolektiva.social</a>. It has grown rapidly since then, thanks in large part to its open registrations and the increasingly widespread and apparent need for alternatives to the dominant social media platforms. It is important to note that Kolektiva.social started as an ad hoc response to a specific problem, mainly related to the ability of social movements to broadcast information publicly, in the context of the summer&#39;s rebellion, and that none of the Kolektiva team were, at that time, especially familiar with the fediverse, from a social point of view, when we started this instance.<br><br></p>\n\n<p>There were controversies, arguments, and accusations. So, as we entered 2021, Kolektiva.social began an (ongoing) effort to expand our number of moderators and to clarify our expectations of users, and users’ expectations of us. Kolektiva.social is just one component of a larger project that is aimed at getting as many people off of corporate social media as possible, and especially people who are involved in anti-colonial, anti-capitalist, and anti-fascist movements. It is also a volunteer project, and time is limited. As a result, we expect it to take us a while to really get a handle of what we&#39;re trying to accomplish here, how we should try to accomplish it, and what exactly is within our capacities. Nevertheless, we don&#39;t intend to go anywhere, and we are committed to learning from our mistakes and always improving on past failures.</p>\n\n<h2>THE GOALS OF KOLEKTIVA</h2>\n\n<p>Kolektiva exists to provide digital infrastructure for anarchist and anti-colonial movements. We seek to enable as many people as possible to share news and information without relying on centralized and intensively surveilled platforms. We are motivated in this work by the principle of internationalism, and a desire to increase communication and collaboration across state-imposed borders and linguistic divides.<br><br>\nIn the coming years, we hope to scale up the project in a number of ways by doing all of the following:<br><br>\n<ol>\n<li>encouraging the exodus of anarchists and other anti-capitalists/anti-colonialists from corporate platforms towards independent, open-source alternatives such as those offered by Kolektiva</li>\n<li>producing instructional videos for new users, and resources for those seeking to set up their own fediverse sites/instances</li>\n<li>building up our physical server infrastructure and technical capacity</li>\n<li>expanding and diversifying our moderation team</li>\n<li>experimenting with other <a href=\"https://activitypub.rocks/\">ActivityPub</a> platforms, such as <a href=\"https://mobilizon.org/en/\">Mobilizon</a> and <a href=\"https://pixelfed.org/\">Pixelfed</a></li>\n<li>introducing a new framework to better organize content and facilitate translation</li></ol></p>\n\n<h2>DONATIONS</h2>\n\n<p>Donations are welcome and appreciated.

Leider kommt es bei folgenden Mail-Anbietern zu Problemen, weshalb eine Registrierung (eventuell) nicht möglich ist:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>gmail.com</strong><br>Da sich ein Großteil der Spam-Accounts mit gmail.com registriert, haben wir die Registrierung über gmail.com gesperrt. Habt ihr eure Mail-Adresse bei Google, könnt ihr bei der Registrierung einfach <strong>gmail.com</strong> durch <strong>googlemail.com</strong> ersetzen.</li>\n<li><strong>Yahoo</strong><br>Von Yahoo kommt aktuell der Großteil der Spamaccounts. Gleichzeitig haben wir fast keine echten Nutzer mit Yahoo-Adressen, so dass diese Mailadresse Stand April 2024 erst einmal gesperrt ist.</li>\n<li><strong>outlook, live, hotmail</strong><br>Leider sperrt Microsoft gerne kleinere Mail-Server wie unseren. Die Registrierungsmails können dann nicht zugestellt werden. Wir empfehlen euch generell einen anderen Mail-Anbieter zu verwenden, da nie garantiert werden kann, dass Mails die euch erreichen sollen, auch ankommen.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Backups und Verfügbarkeit</h3>\n\n<p>Es werden tägliche Backups der Instanz angelegt.<br>\nNRW.social wird privat in unserer Freizeit betrieben.\nWir behalten uns vor, den Dienst jederzeit aus rechtlichen, technischen oder finanziellen Gründen einzuschränken oder zu beenden.\nSollte dies der Fall sein, geben wir uns Mühe, dies mindestens 3 Monate im Voraus bekannt zu geben.</p>\n\n<h4>Serverstatus</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://status.nrw.social/api/badge/1/uptime/24?&label=Mastodon&labelSuffix=\"><img src=\"https://status.nrw.social/api/badge/5/uptime/24?&label=Mail-Server&labelSuffix=\"></p>\n\n<p>Unter <a href=\"https://status.nrw.social\">https://status.nrw.social</a> befindet sich ein Status Monitoring für die Dienste von NRW.social.

            "full_description": "<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>\n\n<p>(For the <strong>rules</strong> scroll down below!!)</p>\n\n<p>This Code contains the rules and principles for participating in the Mastodon.world community. It is intended to protect all members of our community from harassment and to ensure that our community is as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This is a working document, so the Mastodon.world team may amend it from time to time.</p>\n\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Provide a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, political affiliation, or other similar characteristic.</li>\n<li>Create a supportive community, where people freely share their passions and are excited and positive about each other’s successes.</li>\n<li>Protect our community from harassment, malicious or illegal content and from individual members whose goals are to disrupt our community and promote their own self-interest at the expense of the community.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Principles that Guide us</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>We are not a free speech zone.</strong> This CoC lays out expected standards of conduct and behavior. You cannot say or post anything that violates these rules or principles and remain a member of our community. You must follow this CoC. If you are looking for something else, please do. It is not here.</li>\n<li><strong>The Moderators are not morality or thought police.</strong> Moderators are guided by this Code of Conduct. Post what you want, if what you post follows these rules, principles and the goals outlined above. Not every member of the community will appreciate controversial or explicit posts so use Content Warnings very liberally. We use Content Warnings so community members themselves can decide whether they want to see or engage with a post that may be controversial or explicit.</li>\n<li><strong>Bullies, trolls and disruptors</strong> are not welcome in Mastodon.world. We will moderate accordingly.</li>\n<li><strong>This is a voluntary community. You chose to be here.</strong> When you choose to join, you have implied that you agree with this Code of Conduct and will follow it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Rules for posting</h2>\n\n<p>The rules you need to follow if you want to be a member of our community are stated below.</p>\n\n<h2>General guidance on posting and participating in Mastodon.world</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do not post about inflammatory, controversial subjects without a Content Warning.</strong> Ideally, you would not post about inflammatory subjects at all. However, it may be acceptable to do so in some cases, but it is never acceptable to post inflammatory content without hiding the content behind an appropriate Content Warning.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not post any type of nudity without a Content Warning.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Regarding Spam: We are not your free advertising platform.</strong> If you are here only to sell your products or services, you will be removed. Occasional posts of commercial links are OK, but when the vast majority of a user&#39;s posts are commercial in nature, we regard the account as a Spam account. Moderators will evaluate reports of Spam on a case by case basis.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not engage in name calling</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ad%20hominem\">ad hominem</a> attacks, or any other uncivil behaviour. Criticize ideas, never people.</li>\n<li><strong>Misgendering</strong>, the act of referring to someone using a gender or pronouns that do not correctly reflect their gender identity, is prohibited. Deliberate or targeted misgendering, where there is an intentional refusal to respect an individual&#39;s self-identified gender and pronouns, is considered a form of harassment and discrimination. </li>\n<li><strong>Deadnaming</strong>, which involves referring to a transgender or gender-diverse person by a name they used before their gender transition, is prohibited.</li>\n<li><strong>The promotion or endorsement of so-called &quot;conversion therapy&quot;</strong> or any related programs or practices is prohibited. Conversion therapy, which aims to change an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity, is a discredited practice that is harmful and disrespectful to the LGBTQ+ community.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not report every post that upsets you.</strong> Please report posts that violate our rules but for others that you may find distasteful, or just don’t like, use the tools available to you. You can block the user or mute the conversation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Moderation Principles</h2>\n\n<p>Reported content will be assessed on a balance of probabilities by the moderators. In other words, whether it is more likely than not that the content violates one or more of these rules. Moderators will suspend an account from mastodon.world when the user demonstrates that they have breached any rule several times, or if their content (including profile description) suggests that they are likely to continue to break the rules. The number of breaches leading to suspension is deliberately not defined. In egregious cases, one breach can result in suspension of the user account.\n<br><br>\nThe moderation team takes a pragmatic approach to every report they receive - if they feel that a problematic post isn’t explicitly a breach of any of these rules but is inappropriate for Mastodon.world, the post will likely be removed. Users who repeatedly post problematic content or otherwise are seen by the moderators as a negative, disruptive presence in our community can be removed at the discretion of the moderation team, even if those posts or the user did not explicitly violate our rules.</p>\n\n<h1>Staff</h1>\n\n<p>This server has the following administrators:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mastodon.world/@ruud\">@ruud</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mastodon.world/@jeroen\">@jeroen</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The server has the following moderators:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mastodon.world/@stevo\">@stevo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mastodon.world/@KTR\">@KTR</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mastodon.world/@Paul\">@Paul</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mastodon.world/@MichelleG\">@MichelleG</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mastodon.world/@solarbranka\">@solarbranka</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mastodon.world/@magesh\">@magesh</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mastodon.world/@sokian\">@sokian</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Donations &amp; Finances</h1>\n\n<p>Mastodon.world is run by <a href=\"https://mastodon.world/@ruud\">@ruud</a>, who also pays the bills.<br>\nSince the November 2022 user influx, those bills have gone up quite steeply.<br>\nFor those who would like to contribute, the following options for donations are available:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/fhfworld\">KoFi</a> - Preferred.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://liberapay.com/fhf/\">Liberapay</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://opencollective.com/mastodonworld\">OpenCollective</a> (Either recurring or one-time donations).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/mastodonworld\">Patreon</a> (Recurring donations only)\n<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The running costs of Mastodon currently consist of:<br></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hetzner server </li>\n<li>Hetzner backup server</li>\n<li>Hetzner cloud VPS for monitoring, blog etc</li>\n<li>Mailgun e-mailer </li>\n<li>Wasabi storage</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Monthly updates about the finances can be found at <a href=\"https://blog.mastodon.world\">our blog</a></p>\n\n<h1>Status / Uptime</h1>\n\n<p>You can view the status and uptime <a href=\"https://status.mastodon.world\">here</a></p>\n\n<h1>Instance images</h1>\n\n<p>A special thank you to <a href=\"https://mastodon.world/@vsp\">@vsp (Vincent)</a> for creating the :mastodonworld: emoji, as well as the server image and the profile pictures for <a href=\"https://mastodon.world/@mwadmin\">@mwadmin</a>. </p>\n",

            "full_description": "<h1>hessen.social</h1>\n\n<p>Wir möchten eine freundliche, sichere und inklusive Mastodon-Instanz für alle Menschen bieten, die sich unseren Zielen und Hessen verbunden fühlen. Hier möchten wir eine Umgebung schaffen in der sich Menschen freundlich austauschen und diskutieren können, ohne persönlichen Angriffen oder Stigmatisierung ausgesetzt zu sein.<br>\nUm dieses Ziel so gut wie möglich zu erreichen haben wir die folgenden Nutzungsbedingungen geschaffen, die wir auf dieser Instanz auch entsprechend umsetzen. Solltest du mit diesen Bedingungen nicht einverstanden sein, so möchten wir dir nahe legen dir eine andere Instanz zu suchen.</p>\n\n<h2>Was ist Mastodon?</h2>\n<p>Mastodon ist ein offenes soziales Netzwerk. Es basiert auf offenen Web-Protokollen und freier, quelloffener Software. Es ist dezentral (so wie E-Mail!).</p>\n<h5>Infos zu Mastodon findest du auf beispielsweise unter folgenden Links:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mobilsicher.de/ratgeber/mastodon-das-bessere-twitter\">Mastodon – das bessere Twitter? (mobilsicher.de)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.rosenblut.org/2018/08/17/mastodon-das-social-media-netzwerk-erklaert/\">Mastodon – das Social Media Netzwerk erklärt (rosenblut.org)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Falls du von Twitter kommst oder überlegst zu wechseln können wir dir diesen Beitrag von <a href=\"https://contentnation.net/de/favstarmafia/artikel1\">contentnation.net</a> ans Herz legen.<br></p>\n<h5>Tipps und Tricks gibt es u.a. hier:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://contentnation.net/de/favstarmafia/artikel1\">Was Du (als Twitterer) über Mastodon wissen solltest (contentnation.net)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://schwarzerpfeil.de/2020/12/08/mastodon-guide-leitfaden/\">Ausbruch aus dem Vogelkäfig – Ein Mastodon-Guide (schwarzerpfeil.de)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hopidd.de/mastodon\">Eine kleine Mastodon Anleitung (hopidd.de)</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2>Nutzungsbedingungen</h2>\n<p>Für das Erstellen und den Betrieb eines Kontos auf diesem Mastodon-Server ist die Zustimmung zu den nachfolgenden Nutzungsbedingungen erforderlich. Die Moderation setzt diese Regeln aktiv durch. Nichtbeachtung kann verschiedene Maßnahmen wie einfache Ermahnungen, Löschung von Beiträgen, zeitweise/dauerhafte Sperrungen bis hin zur Löschung eines Kontos zur Folge haben.<br>\nEinige dieser Maßnahmen können auch bei Nutzer:innen anderer Instanzen erfolgen. Auch die Sperrung aller Inhalte anderer Instanzen ist möglich.</p>\n\n<h3>Accounts</h3>\n<p>Diese Instanz ist für den persönlichen Austausch natürlicher Nutzer:innen und der Präsentation von Vereinigungen oder Organisationen mit Sitz in Hessen gedacht. Voll-automatisierte Accounts sind nicht gestattet. Das schließt insbesondere Accounts ein, auf denen mit Automationswerkzeugen geposted, aber nie anders interagiert wird (Antworten, Boosten, etc.). Ausnahmen von dieser Regelung siehe „Bots“.<br>\nAktive Nutzer:innen dürfen ergänzend Werkzeuge für automatisches Posten verwenden. (z.B. Crossposter).</p>\n\n<h3>Mindestalter</h3>\nUnser Angebot erfordert eine Zustimmung zu den Datenschutzrichtlinien. Gemäß DSGVO ist dies nur Personen möglich die das 16. Lebensjahr vollendet haben. Wenn du unter 16 Jahren bist, darfst du diese Plattform daher leider nicht benutzen.\n\n<h3>Allgemeine Verhaltensregeln</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sei immer freundlich und höflich. Behandle andere mit Respekt.</li>\n<li>Belästige und beleidige niemanden und unterlasse persönliche Angriffe.Weder allein noch als Gruppe. Das Veröffentlichen oder die Androhung von Veröffentlichung von personen-identifizierenden Informationen (\"doxing\") wird als Belästigung ausgelegt.</li>\n<li>Kontaktiere keine Nutzer:innen die angegeben haben, dass sie nicht kontaktiert werden möchten.</li>\n<li>Die Nutzung oder Befürwortung von rassistischer, sexistischer, homophober, transphober, behindertenfeindlicher und anderweitig diskriminierender oder hasserfüllter Sprache bzw. verharmlosende oder gutheißende Inhalte zu Weißer Vorherrschaft, Antisemitismus, Transphobie oder anderen hasserfüllten Ideologien wird nicht geduldet.</li>\n<li>Nochmal ganz deutlich: Wir dulden keine nationalistische Propaganda, keine Nazi-Symbolik und keine Förderung der Ideologie des Nationalsozialismus!</li>\n<li>Nachgewiesene Falschinformationen/Fakenews sind hier unerwünscht.</li>\n<li>Poste keine pornographischen oder sexualisierten Inhalte. Dazu gehören auch Witze und Kommentare.</li>\n<li>Halte dich an die in Deutschland geltenden Gesetze (verbietet u.a. auch gewaltverherrlichende Inhalte).</li>\n<li>Veröffentliche keinen Spam oder kommerzielle Werbung. Kommerzielle Werbung in diesem Zusammenhang bedeutet, wenn die veröffentlichten Inhalte keinen persönlichen Bezug aufweisen und eindeutig dazu gedacht sind, direkt oder indirekt Geld zu erwirtschaften.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Öffentliche Toots</h3>\n<p>Bei öffentliche Toots müssen zusätzlich die folgende Punkte beachtet werden:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><h5>Nutze Inhaltswarnungen</h5>\nVeröffentliche keine Inhalte über kontroverse, aufrührerische oder triggernde Themen ohne eine Inhaltswarnung zu verwenden.</li>\n<li><h5>Keine Killerphrasen, schwarze Rhetorik oder Sophismus</h5>\nDies gebietet bereits ein respektvoller Umgang. Dennoch möchten wir nochmals betonen, dass unsachliche Diskussionsbeiträge die der vorsätzlichen Schädigung der Diskussion zur Folge haben unerwünscht sind. Dazu zählen bspw. auch Scheinargument-Attacken (auch ad hominem genannt) oder die Kritik an inklusiver Sprache, wenn diese nicht das Thema der Diskussion ist.</li>\n<li><h5>Kritik an Moderationsentscheidungen</h5>\nDiskutiere Moderationsentscheidungen nicht zuerst in öffentlichen Toots. Wenn Du nicht einverstanden bist wie ein Moderation diese Bedingungen interpretiert und anwendet, dann kontaktiere uns. Schicke eine Mail an kontakt@hessen.social oder schreibe eine Direktnachricht an @moomendemol@hessen.social</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bugs</h3>\n<p>Gefundene Fehler in der Software auf hessen.social sind umgehend zu melden.</p>\n\n<h3>Melden & Moderation</h3>\n<p>Wenn dir hier ein Toot auffällt, der diesen Kodex verletzt, melde das bitte immer. Es ist gut möglich, dass jemand anderes diesen Inhalt bereits gemeldet hat. Allerdings passiert es schnell, dass alle so denken und es am Ende niemand meldet.</p>\n\n<h3>Bots</h3>\n<p>Spezielle Bot-Accounts sind erlaubt, soweit sie die nachfolgenden Bedingungen erfüllen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Es gelten die gleichen Regelungen wie für alle anderen Accounts.</li>\n<li>Es muss eine erreichbare Kontaktperson in der Beschreibung des Bots in einem Tabellenfeld 'Kontaktperson' zu finden sein.</li>\n<li>Die Profilbeschreibung muss einen kurzen Text über den Sinn und Zweck des Bots enthalten.</li>\n<li>Bots dürfen lediglich Nicht gelistet posten, um mehr Raum für relevantere, lokale Inhalte zu bieten.</li>\n<li>Ausnahmen von diesen Regelungen sind nach Absprache möglich.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Unzulässige/gesperrte Maildomains</h3>\n<p>Aufgrund von zunehmenden Spamaccounts wurde die Nutzung von Wegwerfmailadressen und häufigen Spammerdomains unterbunden (siehe auch nächsten Abschnitt zu gmail.com).<br>\nDie gesperrten Domains finden sich hier: <a href=\"https://github.com/disposable-email-domains/disposable-email-domains\">https://github.com/disposable-email-domains/disposable-email-domains</a>\n<br><br>\nSollte sich in dieser Liste eine Domain befinden die ihr selber nutzt und dort als falsch erachtet, könnt ihr<br>\n1. unter dem o.g. Link ein Issue eröffnen um die Domain von der Sperrliste zu nehmen<br>\n2. falls 1. nicht klappt oder nicht möglich ist, uns eine Mail schreiben um eine lokale Ausnahme zu erstellen.</p>\n\n<h3>GMail-Nutzer:innen</h3>\n<p>Nach zwei Wochen Betrieb zeigt sich bereits, dass von Maildomains mit der Endung \"@gmail.com\" eine enorme Menge Spamaccounts angelegt werden. Daher ist die Domain ab sofort gesperrt.\nWenn du eine Google-Adresse nutzen willst, dann ersetze @gmail.com einfach durch @googlemail.com, das funktioniert auch. Alternativ kannst du natürlich auch eine andere Mailadresse nehmen, am besten von einem Mailprovider der deine Mailinhalte nicht durchforstet und zu Werbezwecken nutzt.</p>\n\n<h3>Automatische Löschung von Accounts</h3>\n<p>Wir behalten uns vor, Nutzeraccounts, die keine Aktivität zeigen, zu löschen. Die Aktivität wird unter anderem am letzten Login und der Tootaktivität festgemacht. So fallen bspw. Accounts die 3 Monate ohne Login sind und noch nie etwas getootet haben unter diese Regelung.</p>\n\n<h3>Rechtliches</h3>\nBei der Nutzung des Angebots findet deutsches Recht Anwendung. Gerichtsstand ist Darmstadt. Die Nutzung erfolgt ausschließlich freiwillig. Die Nutzung des Dienstes kann von den Betreiber:innen ohne Angabe von Gründen untersagt werden.\nEs gelten die separaten Datenschutzbestimmungen.\n\n<h2>Weiterführende Informationen über diesen Server</h2>\n<h3>Mastodon Server Covenant</h3>\n<p>Dieser Server verfolgt die <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/covenant\">Mastodon Server Covenant</a>\n<ol>\n<li><h5>Aktive Moderation gegen Rassismus, Homophobie und Transphobie</h5>\nSiehe <a href=\"https://hessen.social/about/more#nutzungsbedingungen\">Nutzungsbedingungen und Regeln</a></li>\n<li><h5>Tägliche Backups</h5>\nWir erstellen tägliche automatische und verschlüsselte externe Backups</li>\n<li><h5>Mindestens eine weitere Person mit (Notfall)Zugang zur Serverinfrastruktur</h5>\nSiehe <a href=\"https://hessen.social/about/more#backup-admin\">Backup-Admin</a></li>\n<li><h5>Zusicherung, dass User mindestens drei Monate im Voraus benachrichtigt werden, falls der Dienst eingestellt werden sollte</h5>\nWir behalten uns das Recht vor diesen Dienst jederzeit einzustellen.

Unser Ziel ist es daher nicht nur den rechtlichen Vorgaben wie der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung (kurz \"DSGVO\") zu genügen, sondern bei der notwendigen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten die maximal technisch mögliche Datensparsamkeit zu erreichen. Ganz ohne Datenverarbeitung geht es aber nicht. Welche Daten wir verarbeiten und ewarum findest du in unserer <a href=\"https://hessen.social/terms\">Datenschutzerklärung</a></p>\n\n<h3>Spenden</h3>\n\n<p>Der Betrieb von hessen.social und das zugehörige Monitoring und Backup kostet uns Geld. Die Nutzung von hessen.social wird immer kosten- und werbefrei bleiben. Anstatt uns aber Geld für den Betrieb dieses Servers zu zahlen, gebt doch lieber Geld an das <a href=\"https://www.betterplace.org/de/organisations/24807-computerwerk-darmstadt-e-v\">Computerwerk</a>. Dafür gibt es auch eine Spendenquittung :)</p>\n\n<h3>Danksagung</h3>\n\n<p>Vielen Dank an die Fediverse-Community und insbesondere <a href=\"https://darmstadt.social/@w4tsn\">@w4tsn von darmstadt.social</a>, der uns beim Einstieg unterstützt hat :)</p>\n",

It lays out our expected standards of conduct and behaviours that all </span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>mstdn.ca</strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> users must follow while using this platform.</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>We believe that freedom of expression is not freedom of reach.</strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> You may say whatever you want, but we reserve the right to keep you from using our platform to say it. Bullies, trolls and disruptors are not welcome in </span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>mstdn.ca</strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> and neither are users that engage in name-calling, ad-hominem attacks, or other uncivil behaviour. These activities will be actioned accordingly based on our Code of Conduct.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>This is a voluntary community and you choose to be here.</strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> By joining and using this service, you give your tacit agreement to our Code of Conduct and agree to follow it, or risk losing your privilege to access this platform.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Code of Conduct | Our server rules</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>No toxic and hateful speech.</strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> We have a zero-tolerance policy on toxic and hateful speech. This includes attacks against anyone&rsquo;s gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, age, disability, personal appearance, or socio-economic status. Discussions related to these topics can be difficult because we don't have similar lived experiences. If you choose to discuss these topics, empathy and kindness are a must, and if you&rsquo;re not able to do so, just mute and move on.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>No incitement of violence and no promotion of misleading or violent ideologies. </strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\">You may not make specific threats of violence or physical harm, death, or disease to an individual or group of people. This includes, but is not limited to, threatening or promoting misleading information that may lead to physical harm. You also may not affiliate with organisations that &mdash; whether by their own statements or activity both on and off the platform &mdash; use or promote violence against civilians to further their causes.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>No harassment, dogpiling, or unwanted advances. </strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\">You may not continue to engage with a user who has explicitly requested that you stop. This includes consistent baiting, bad-faith gaslighting, unwanted sexual advances, etc.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>No doxxing of other users. </strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\">Unauthorised requests for or distribution of any personal information or data is not allowed. Please treat personally identifying information with respect and privacy.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>No content illegal in Canada or copyrighted content that you don't own rights to. </strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\">Illegal or copyrighted content is not allowed to be stored, posted, or discussed on mstdn.ca&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>Sexually explicit or violent media must be marked appropriately.</strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> Posts and images with sexually explicit or violence must be flagged as sensitive and contain a content warning noting either &lsquo;NSFW&rsquo; or &lsquo;Violence&rsquo; when posting. Users may not have sexually explicit or violent media as a profile photo or header image. There are also types of sensitive media content that we don&rsquo;t allow at all, including violent sexual conduct, gratuitous gore, and hateful imagery. We prohibit violent sexual conduct to prevent the normalization of sexual assault and non-consensual violence associated with sexual acts. We prohibit gratuitous gore content because research has shown that repeated exposure to violent content online may negatively impact an individual&rsquo;s well-being.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>No spamming.</strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> Excessive posting, boosting, advertising or mass-marketing posts will be actioned accordingly and based on intent.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>Be yourself. </strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\">Accounts intended to impersonate or parody are not permitted, and those found to be directly misrepresenting themselves as another person or entity will be actioned accordingly. General parody accounts like Beaverton or CBC Pitchbot are allowed as they are not impersonating a person or entity.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Community guidelines | Our norms</h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #353744;\">The list below is a collection of norms and behaviours that will help us build a community that we all want to participate in. While these best practices are designed to be guidelines for a good communal instance, repeated malicious unwillingness to follow the best practices will be considered just like breaking a rule (it&rsquo;s all about intent).</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>We are not an advertising platform.</strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> If you are here only to sell your products or services, you will be removed. Occasional posts of commercial links are acceptable, but if the vast majority of a user's posts are commercial in nature, we will regard the account as a spam account. Moderators will evaluate reports of spam on a case-by-case basis.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>Do not report every post that upsets you.</strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> Please report posts that violate our Code of Conduct. For other posts that you find distasteful or don&rsquo;t like but don&rsquo;t violate the rules, use the mute, filter, or block functionality. Let the moderation team focus on the real problematic posts.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>Be considerate.</strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> In general, use the tools provided to foster a considerate and accessible atmosphere. This includes the liberal use of:</span></li>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\">Content warnings (CWs) are a kind way to let people choose to opt-out of potentially disturbing or controversial topics like spoilers or triggering/traumatic posts. CWs are also mandatory on posts containing gore, violence, or NSFW. If in doubt, err on the side of caution.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\">Alt-text captioning of media files can help our vision-impaired community members join in on the discussion. Alt-text is needed for those who rely upon screen readers to read what's on their screen. Without this, screen readers can't describe images to those who can't see them.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\">#CamelCase use of hashtags can help screen readers read the hashtags properly.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>Give credit where it&rsquo;s due.</strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> When possible, provide credit for creative works in your posts that are not your own.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>Don&rsquo;t be a creep.</strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> Uninvited comments about another user&#39;s personal choices, lifestyle or family are strongly discouraged and may be considered harassment.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>Be respectful.</strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> In discussions, please remain civil, and do not insult the person you&#39;re talking to. Note that irony, sarcasm, or similar modes of language don&#39;t translate well to written language and tend to escalate discussions or misunderstandings. Criticize ideas, not people.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\"><strong>Boosts are endorsements.</strong></span><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> You are responsible for what you boost. If you boost content that doesn&#39;t comply with our rules, moderators may take action.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Moderation Principles and Commitment</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #353744;\">Coming soon!</span></p>\n<h2>Appeals process</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #353744;\">Upon receipt of an appeal request, the instance operator, along with 2 moderators will review the appeal and make the final decision to uphold or overturn based on a vote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #353744;\">Intent to make a fair and transparent appeals process&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2>The team</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://mstdn.ca/@chad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@chad</a><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> - Instance Administrator | Edmonton, AB | he/him/il | EN, some FR</span><br>\n<a href=\"http://mstdn.ca/@codebam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@codebam</a><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> - System Administrator | Peterborough, ON | they/them | EN</span><br>\n<a href=\"https://mstdn.ca/@rcjcarr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@rcjcarr</a><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> - Moderator | Ottawa, ON | he/him | EN</span><br>\n<a href=\"https://mstdn.ca/@adam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@adam</a><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> - Moderator | Vancouver, BC | he/him | EN</span><br>\n<a href=\"https://mstdn.ca/@c_9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@c&#95;9</a><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> - Moderator/Documentation/Graphic Design | Toronto, ON | he/him | EN</span><br>\n<a href=\"https://mstdn.ca/@samloonie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@samloonie</a><span style=\"color: #353744;\"> - Moderator | Ottawa, ON | EN</span></p>\n<h2>Bot account policy</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\">The account must have checked the profile option &quot;This is a bot account&quot;.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\">Posts from the bot account must be &quot;unlisted&quot;.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #353744;\">Must enable &quot;Automated post deletion&quot; with a maximum age threshold of one month, with the exception of pinned posts and direct messages.

            "full_description": "<p><strong>sciences.social</strong> is an online community for <em>social scientists</em>. Users here can connect with one another <em>and the millions of other Mastodon users</em> who have opted for social media that is ad-free and actively moderated to keep bad actors at bay. Here&#39;s how to get started.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Create an account</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"/auth/sign_up\" target='_blank'>Create an account</a> \nto get started. You&#39;ll be asked to agree to some ground rules. You can post about almost anything on sciences.social, but we don&#39;t allow sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, casteism or abusive behavior. </p>\n\n<p>Once you confirm your email you&#39;ll be online. Come on back to this page (<a href=\"/about\">sciences.social/about</a>) for next steps.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Get an app</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884\">Ice Cubes for iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keylesspalace.tusky\">Tusky for Android</a> are very good and free. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mona-for-mastodon/id1659154653\">Mona</a> and  <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274\">ivory</a> are excellent apps for iOS/Mac users with a few dollars to spare.</p>\n\n<p>Mastodon also works well from a web browser on laptops and desktops. A browser extension like Graze (<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/graze-for-mastodon/epocinhmkcnjfjobnglchpbncndobblj\">chrome</a>, <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/graze/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search\">mozilla</a>) or FediAct (<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fediact/lmpcajpkjcclkjbliapfjfolocffednm\">chrome</a>, <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fediact/\">mozilla</a>) will make following folks from other Mastodon servers seamless. Highly recommended.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Follow lots of folks</h2>\n\n<p>Thousands of social scientists are active on Mastodon, and you can follow anyone regardless of which server they call home. There&#39;s no algorithm to fill your feed with content so it helps to follow liberally. Our companion site <strong><a href=\"https://find.sciences.social\">find.sciences.social</a></strong> makes it easy to find and follow academics from many different disciplines including <a href=\"https://find.sciences.social/search?field=sociology\">Sociology</a>, <a href=\"https://find.sciences.social/search?q=&field=communication-and-media-studies\">Communication and Media Studies</a>, and <a href=\"https://find.sciences.social/search?q=&field=political-scientists\">Political Science</a>. <a href=\"https://followgraph.vercel.app/\">Followgraph</a> finds folks who are popular among the people you already follow.</p>\n\n<p>You can also follow hashtags like <a href=\"/tags/ASA2023\">#ASA2023</a> to see what people are posting about the conference. Or follow <a href=\"/tags/rstats\">#rstats</a> for hints on R and <a href=\"/tags/academicchatter\">#AcademicChatter</a> for - you know. Or maybe just <a href=\"/tags/naturephotography\">#NaturePhotography</a> for some pleasant views.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Start Posting and Boosting</h2>\n\n<p>Introduce yourself with your first post, and include an <a href=\"/tags/introduction\">#introduction</a> hashtag. Post about whatever you want, and use hashtags to make finding your posts easier. If you see a post you like, boost it. There&#39;s no algorithm to amplify selected voices here so we rely on boosting to see what&#39;s interesting.</p>\n\n<h1>More about us</h1>\n\n<p><em>sciences.social</em> welcomes all social scientists, including professors, grad students and anyone with a graduate degree in the social sciences (sociology, anthropology, political science, communications, economics...), including people who are doing qualitative and quantitative work inside or outside academia.  We want this to be a comfortable place for social scientists from all backgrounds, including those who are from marginalized or racialized groups, sexual minorities, people with disabilities and others who may not feel welcomed in some academic spaces. </p>\n\n<p><em>sciences.social</em> is collectively funded. It was started by <a href=\"http://www.markigra.com/\">Mark Igra</a> (<a href=\"https://sciences.social/@markigra\">@markigra</a>), a PhD student who earned enough money to start the site in a previous career. While Mark will continue to ensure sciences.social is funded, donations have helped pay for the rapid growth of the site. <strong>We encourage you to donate</strong> through <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/socialsciences\">Ko-fi</a></p>\n\n<p>Mark runs this site with the help of a crew of moderators (<a href=\"https://sciences.social/@pratik\">Pratik</a>, <a href=\"https://sciences.social/@koerselman\">Kristian</a>, and <a href=\"https://sciences.social/@simonlindgren\">Simon</a>. Let us know if you would like to help out.</p>\n\n<h3>Policies</h3>\n\n<p>At the moment, the official rules are deliberately minimal, but they have important implications. First, if you don&#39;t understand that &quot;treat people with respect&quot; means no sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia or casteism and precludes abusive behavior and doxxing, then you don&#39;t belong on this site. Second, you must use your real name in your profile and we strongly encourage using your full name as your display name. While there are plenty of good reasons for anonymity on the internet, for our purposes being able to link online reputation to real-world reputation is important.</p>\n\n<h3>Post Visibility</h3>\n\n<p>Public posts appear on the local timelines and federated timelines of sciences.social and all other mastodon instances that host your followers. Consider using Unlisted for posts you want your followers to see, but would prefer not to appear in public timelines. <strong>Using Unlisted for replies is strongly encouraged.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Posts expressing racism, homophobia and the like are not allowed with or without a content warning or with any level of visibility.</p>\n\n<h3>Sensitive Media</h3>\n\n<p>You must mark media as sensitive if it contains violence or sexual content. We also request that you mark media as sensitive if it might trigger common phobias including arachnophobia (fear of spiders) and Ophidiophobia (fear of snakes).</p>\n\n<h3>Getting along</h3>\n\n<p>Folks come here from different academic, ethnic and national cultures, so there are likely to be some mismatches in tone when we talk to one another. People might be more blunt than you are used to, or you might think someone is frustratingly obtuse when they are just trying to be polite. It&#39;s best to presume that folks here are acting in good faith. Mastodon has good tools for filtering or blocking posts you don&#39;t want to see. However, if you think someone is deliberately violating the rules or negatively affecting the community as a whole, you can report them as described below.</p>\n\n<h3>Reporting bad behavior</h3>\n\n<p>One of the great strengths of Mastodon is the ability to restrict access to bad actors. sciences.social already blocks posts from dozens of sites known to host trolls and nazis, but there&#39;ll be other bad behavior. If you use the &quot;Report&quot; action on someone&#39;s post the moderators can review it and take action to restrict that account. Reporting helps even for people who make their home on other servers.</p>\n\n<h3>Content Warnings</h3>\n\n<p>Content warnings are an important part of both the technical infrastructure and the culture of the Mastodon online community. They aren&#39;t just used for &quot;triggering&quot; content but also are often treated as a “headline” that allows people to choose whether they want to read the whole post. Click the CW link on your post to set one.</p>\n\n<p>We strongly encourage the use of content warnings for posts that you think might be triggering or of limited interest, for example mentions of death or violence, and political debates centered on one country or locality.</p>\n\n<p>While expressions of racism, casteism, homophobia, and transphobia are off-limits, we do not require content warnings for posts <em>about</em> those topics and their effects on people, whether academic or otherwise. Use your own judgment about using content warnings on these topics.</p>\n\n<h2>Site Visualization</h2>\n\n<p>The header image is a public domain visualization from <a href=\"https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/w-e-b-du-bois-hand-drawn-infographics-of-african-american-life-1900\">W.E.B.

We use Content Warnings so community members themselves can decide whether they want to see or engage with a post that may be controversial or explicit.</li>\n<li><strong>Bullies, trolls, and disruptors</strong> are not welcome in our community. We will moderate accordingly.</li>\n<li><strong>This is a voluntary community. You chose to be here.</strong> When you decide to join, you have implied that you agree with this Code of Conduct and will follow it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Rules for posting</h2>\n\n<p>The rules you need to follow if you want to be a member of our community are stated below.</p>\n\n<h2>General guidance on posting and participating in this community</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do not post about inflammatory, controversial subjects without a Content Warning.</strong> Ideally, you would not post about provocative topics at all. However, it may be acceptable to do so in some cases. Still, posting inflammatory content without hiding the content behind an appropriate Content Warning is never good.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not post any nudity without a Content Warning.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Regarding Spam: We are not your free advertising platform.</strong> You will be removed if you are here only to sell your products or services. Occasional posts of commercial links are OK, but when most of a user&#39;s posts are commercial, we regard the account as Spam account. Moderators will evaluate reports of Spam on a case-by-case basis.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not engage in name-calling</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ad%20hominem\">ad hominem attacks</a>, or other uncivil behavior. Criticize ideas, never people.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not report every post that upsets you.</strong> Please report posts that violate our rules but for others that you may find distasteful or don&#39;t like, use the tools available to you. You can block the user or mute the conversation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Moderation Principles</h2>\n\n<p>Reported content will be assessed on a balance of probabilities by the moderators. In other words, whether it&#39;s more likely than not that the content violates one or more of these rules. Moderators will suspend an account from this community when the user demonstrates that they have breached any rule several times or if their content (including profile description) suggests that they are likely to continue to break the rules. The number of breaches leading to suspension is deliberately not defined. In egregious cases, one violation can result in suspending the user account.</p>\n\n<p>The moderation team takes a pragmatic approach to every report they receive - if they feel that a problematic post isn&#39;t explicitly a breach of any of these rules but is inappropriate for this community, the post will likely be removed. Users who repeatedly post problematic content or are seen by the moderators as a negative, disruptive presence in our community can be removed at the moderation team&#39;s discretion, even if those posts or the user did not explicitly violate our rules.</p>\n\n<h1>Server Statistics / Information</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://fedidb.org/network/instance?domain=toot.community\">FediDB</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fediverse.observer/toot.community\">Fediverse.Observer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://status.toot.community\">Uptime status report</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.toot.community\">Blog</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Contact</h1>\n\n<p>Your questions, feedback, and concerns are always welcome.

            "full_description": "<p>Urbanists.Social is a Mastodon instance for urbanists - people who are into bikes, transit, and / or walkable cities.</p>\n\n<p>Want to donate to us? <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/urbanistssocial\">Check out our Open Collective here!</a></p>\n\n<p>We generally align ourself with the policies and goals of other instances like <a href=\"https://mastodon.social\">mastodon.social</a>, <a href=\"https://awoo.space/\">awoo.space</a>, and <a href=\"icosahedron.website\">icosahedron.website</a>. We want our server to be a safe space for our users. Generally the rules boil down to \"don't be a dick\", but a few worth drawing attention to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Any content that is illegal under US or EU law is prohibited</b>. We're run by a small community, please don't get us in trouble.</li>\n  <li>No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and any other discriminatory conduct that attacks any individual or group of individuals based on what they are or what they believe is strictly forbidden. This excludes shitting on drivers, but still try to be nice.</li>\n  <li>Any conduct that abuses this Mastodon instance, or any other Mastodon instance, is strictly forbidden.</li>\n  <li>Your user profile (including your name and display name) must be SWF. NSFW content is not banned, but please be sure to tag it appropriately.</li>\n  <li>Please be considerate and respectful of others. Consider adding content warnings to your posts about controversial subjects or commonly-held phobias.</li>\n  <li><b>No harassment.</b> Harassment is any improper or unwelcome conduct that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation to another person.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our admins on this server are <a href=\"https://urbanists.social/@sam\">@sam</a> and <a href=\"https://urbanists.social/@zak\">@zak</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This is not Twitter. <b>Reporting posts that make you feel uncomfortable, or that you feel should be brought to our attention, is highly encouraged</b>. Your reports will not be ignored, and will be dealt with (usually) within a few days. It may take more than a week due to timezone differences or jobs, but you will always hear back about your report, and it won't be closed until you're happy with the resolution for the report. If your report involves a user or post on another instance, you have the choice of sharing your report with the administration of that instance as well, but the report will always be sent to us. Please include in the report whether you chose to send the report to the other instance, though.</p>\n\n<p>No moderation actions are automatic whatsoever. Nothing happens without human review.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/covenant\"><b>We follow the Mastodon server covenant.</b></a> If we decide to close the server, we will give you <em>minimum</em> three months notice. Our hosting provider, <a href=\"https://masto.host/\">masto.host</a>, does daily backups of our database.</p>\n\n<h2>Defederation policy</h2>\n\n<p>Defederation occurs when we limit access to other Mastodon instances. We do this through <em>domain blocks</em>, where we silence or suspend other servers by their domain name. <em>Silencing</em> an instance will make all posts from all accounts on the instance invisible to anyone who isn't following them on our server. <em>Suspending</em> will remove all of the instance’s content and media, and will not allow you to follow any users there.</p>\n\n<p>We use domain blocks to keep our server safe, to pressure other instances to moderate more effectively, and to decrease the amount of moderation of remote content we have to do. We monitor the <span class=\"externalcitation\">[#Fediblock]</span>(<a class=\"autolink\" href=\"https://urbanists.social/tags/FediBlock\">https://urbanists.social/tags/FediBlock</a>) for reports from users and admins for troublesome accounts and instances. </p>\n\n<p>We don’t yet have a specific set of rules we follow when blocking instances, but generally this is our policy:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Any instance whose purpose, stated goals, or moderation rules conflict with any of our rules are immediately suspended</strong>. Fairly self-explanatory. We don’t want this content on our server.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Example: We do not allow promotion of crypto. Cryptodon clearly breaks this rule and it has been suspended.</li>\n<li>Another example: There are multiple instances for TERFs. We do not allow TERFs or ‘gender critical’ bullshit on our server, so multiple TERF sites have been suspended.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Instances that do not have adequate prohibition of hate speech or harassment are immediately suspended</strong>.\n\n<ul>\n<li>A large percentage of these instances are ‘free speech’ servers with little to no rules. Remaining federated with these instances opens our users to a high possibility of receiving abuse from them.</li>\n<li>Example: Gab does not have adequate rules against hate speech. It’s an alt-right hellhole known for harassing lots of minorities in the Fediverse. So it has been suspended.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Instances with admins that engage in hate speech or harassment are immediately suspended</strong>.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Admins that do this are not capable of moderating hate speech or harassment, point blank. We do not want our users to be subject to their users’ harassment or hate speech.</li>\n<li>Example: Alex Gleason is a well-known TERF who regularly posts hate speech and harassment on his servers. This behavior attracts more TERFs to his servers who engage in the same behavior. As a result, all instances Gleason runs are suspended on our server.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Instances that are on lots of our peers’ block lists are very likely to be suspended.</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We trust the admin work of our peer instances, especially those that are larger than our own server. As a server that hasn’t received a lot of abuse, we like to prevent it before it happens. Watching other instances’ block lists is key to making this happen.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Instances reported on <span class=\"hashtag\">#FediBlock</span> are very likely to be silenced or suspended.</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If we get repeat reports about an instance on the <span class=\"externalcitation\">[#FediBlock]</span>(<a class=\"autolink\" href=\"https://urbanists.social/tags/FediBlock\">https://urbanists.social/tags/FediBlock</a>) hashtag, we are very likely to take action against that instance. A high frequency of these reports from multiple users usually indicates a good candidate for a domain block.</li>\n<li>Example: The admin of <a class=\"autolink\" href=\"https://journa.host\">journa.host</a> has been the subject of numerous complaints on the FediBlock tag. As a result of this, they have been silenced. This prevents our users from receiving random harassment from their users, while also allowing our users to follow users on the server.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Instances with questionable moderation are highly likely to be silenced or suspended</strong>.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Example: <a class=\"autolink\" href=\"https://c.im\">c.im</a> bans exactly one server. They’ve received numerous complaints on <span class=\"hashtag\">#FediBlock</span> due to their admin not moderating content effectively. As a result of this, we’ve silenced their server.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Instances on Probation</h2>\n\n<p>Users have requested the following instances to be unblocked, and the admins have reviewed them and put them on a probation list. We'll take any reports against these instances seriously and we'll be more likely to block them again.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>qoto.org (23 Nov 2022)\n</ul>\n",

If you don’t agree to all of the terms set out here, please do not use this server. By continuing to use Zirkus, you agree to be bound by the terms set out here.<br></p>\n\n<p><br><em>Guidelines</em><br>\n<ul>\n<li><u>Language:</u> There are no language rules on this server. English is <em>de facto</em> the main language, but feel free (even encouraged!) to post in other languages.</li>\n<li><u>Content warnings:</u> We do not require a content warning (CW) for posts about politics, social justice, etc. However, we ask that you be kind and considerate: include CWs if you believe your post may be distressing.</li>\n<li><u>Bots:</u> Bots are allowed. Try to make them fun.</li>\n<li><u>Cross-posting:</u> Cross-posting from Twitter, RSS, etc. is fine (and even encouraged if it helps you become more active here).</li>\n<li><u>Topics:</u> You do not need to remain permanently &quot;on topic&quot;. The point of this arts/humanities community is to gather like-minded people who will make posts that are interesting to each other. But that doesn&#39;t mean that everything has to be about books, art, etc. This is a community to connect people, not enforce specific topics of discussion.</li>\n<li><u>Self-promotion:</u> There are many writers and artists on this server, and we are more than happy for you to promote your work from your personal account. We request, however, that you do so in a tasteful and not spammy manner.</li>\n<li><u>Industry promotion:</u> If you are a commercial entity of interest to our community (literary magazine, publishing house, etc.), we are also happy for you to promote here in a tasteful manner. However, we request that you make a modest donation, as this is a volunteer-run server that relies on crowdfunding (see below). Please contact the admins if you have any questions.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><br><em>Donations</em><br>\n<ul>\n<li>You can donate to Zirkus on Patreon <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/zirkus\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>We are run entirely by volunteers on a non-profit basis and are dependent on donations to cover our hosting costs.</li>\n<li>We&#39;re currently hosted on <a href=\"https://masto.host\" target=\"_blank\">masto.host</a> and are looking to raise <em>$420/month</em> to support 5,500 users comfortably. We will publish new goals as necessary based on our user numbers.</li>\n<li>We ultimately hope to crowdfund via <a href=\"https://opencollective.com\" target=\"_blank\">Open Collective</a>, which offers greater transparency over expenses and more flexibility for contributors. Our Patreon page is a temporary solution while we await approval from a fiscal host on Open Collective. Once we have migrated crowdfunding to Open Collective, all funds raised on Patreon will be transferred to that account, the Patreon page will be shut down and contributors will be informed of the move.</li>\n<li>Every little helps a lot. We’d like to thank our community for all their support so far!</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><br><em>Moderation and reporting posts</em><br>\n<ul>\n<li>When you report an account or server, please indicate which server rule has been broken and include any extra context or explanation, if possible.</li>\n<li>We are volunteer moderators and will try to address the issue as soon as we are able.</li>\n<li>You will not be notified about the result, even if it has led to punitive action, which may not be visible to the outside. The response will be proportional to the nature of the offence.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><br><em>Post visibility and privacy</em><br>\n<ul>\n<li>Please bear in mind that your posts – depending on their visibility – are public. We recommend not sharing information publicly that you do not intend to share with the whole internet.</li>\n<li>When you post, bear in mind that posts cannot be hidden by locking an account. Posts can be deleted either manually or set to auto-delete within various timeframes. Please familiarize yourself with the different visibility options for posting: Public, Unlisted, Followers Only, and Mentioned People Only (i.e. a direct message).</li>\n<li>The displaying and distribution of your post happens strictly according to the visibility rules you have set for the post. We will not modify the visibility of the post you have set.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><br><em>Your data and privacy</em><br>\n<ul>\n<li>We can see basic account and profile information that you provide when signing up to the server, such as username, email, name (real or fake) and IP address.</li>\n<li>We do not share your information with any third parties.</li>\n<li>The server administrators can technically access users’ direct messages, but pledge not to do so. This option is also not available in the default admin UI. We strongly recommend not sending any confidential or private information via direct message on Mastodon (or equally on Twitter) because the messages are not end-to-end encrypted. WhatsApp and Signal are currently end-to-end encrypted applications.</li>\n<li>We do not log information about your use of this server or run any form of analytics. Our hosting provider, <a href=\"https://masto.host\" target=\"_blank\">masto.host</a>, keeps a log of the IP addresses of the requests made to the server, which is auto-deleted in less than 90 days.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><br><em>Liability</em><br>\n<ul>\n<li>You are responsible for the content that you make available to the server, including its legality and appropriateness. Please abide by the above server rules when using Zirkus.

Everyone is welcome to sign up as long as they are willing to follow our rules set out below.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the information provided below, we also have a blog and about page at <a href=\"https://about.ohai.social/\">about.ohai.social</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Support</h1>\n\n<p>The best way to get in touch for questions and issues concerning the server is through <a href=\"mailto:support@ohai.social\">support@ohai.social</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Donations</h1>\n\n<p>We accept donations toward the operation of the server through <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ohaisocial\">Patreon</a>. </p>\n\n<h1>Moderation team</h1>\n\n<p>There are currently three moderators for ohai.social:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ohai.social/@dee_in_calgary\">@dee_in_calgary</a> (she/her) 🇨🇦</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ohai.social/@lutoma\">@lutoma</a> (he/him) 🇪🇺</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ohai.social/@silsha\">@silsha</a> (he/him) 🇪🇺</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Server status</h1>\n\n<p>You can check the current server status on our monitoring page at <a href=\"https://status.ohai.is/\">status.ohai.is</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Security &amp; Backups</h1>\n\n<p>This Mastodon server is hosted on bare metal in a data center in the south of Germany. Two people have access to the infrastructure, and all SSH access is exclusively using hardware security tokens. We will never sell or otherwise use your data for anything other than the operation of this Mastodon server, and we certainly do not read your DMs.</p>\n\n<p>All database data is backed up twice daily in a physically different location from the live data (Specifically, at <a href=\"https://www.borgbase.com/\">BorgBase</a>).</p>\n\n<p>In the unlikely event that we will ever have to shut down the server, we intend to give at least 6+ months of notice ahead of the shutdown.</p>\n\n<h1>Best practices</h1>\n\n<p>The list below is a collection of behavior that we expect to see from our users. If you see a user go against these best practices in a way that bothers you, please file a report and we will talk to them. While these best practices are designed to be guidelines for a good communal instance, repeated malicious unwillingness to follow the best practices will be considered just like breaking a rule.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In general, use the tools provided to foster a considerate and accessible atmosphere. This includes the liberal use of content warnings (especially on potentially disturbing or controversial topics), and alt-text captioning of media files.</p></li>\n<li><p>When possible, provide credit for creative works in your posts that are not your own.</p></li>\n<li><p>Uninvited comments about another user&#39;s personal choices, lifestyle or family are strongly discouraged and may be considered harassment. Inappropriate sexual attention, comments about appearance and implication of physical contact will not be tolerated toward any non-consenting user.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you post sexual content or gore, use content warnings.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you post advertisements, use a content warning. Advertisements should not be excessive or automated.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bots may only interact with a user when they&#39;re invited by that user to do so.</p></li>\n<li><p>Automated posts and high-frequency posts should be unlisted (rendering visible to everybody, but not appearing on the local timeline) to keep the local timeline of our instance a place of community dialogue and human interaction. This extends to bots, feed posters, Twitter &quot;retweets&quot; and Twitter crossposts with broken mentions (&quot;…@twitter.com&quot;). Crossposter accounts that stop being active participants in our community may be removed at the discretion of the moderators.</p></li>\n<li><p>In discussions, please remain civil, do not insult the people you&#39;re talking to. Note that irony, sarcasm, or similar modes of language don&#39;t translate well to written language and tend to escalate discussions or misunderstandings.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(These best practices were inspired by the Terms of chaos.social and bsd.network.

Unique to this course is the ability to raise or lower the water level based on where the painting is entered; the lower the painting is entered, the lower the water level, and the higher the painting is entered, the higher the water level.</em> \n- <a href=\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Wet-Dry_World\">Super Mario Wiki</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://jortage.com\">\n    <img\n        style=\"width: 290px; height: 130px\"\n        src=\"https://blob.jortage.com/jortage-banner.svg\"\n        alt=\"This instance's media is powered by Jortage Storage Pool — lightning-fast pay-what-you-can media storage for Fediverse instances\"/>\n</a></p>\n\n<p><a href='https://compliance.conversations.im/server/wetdry.world'><img src='https://compliance.conversations.im/badge/wetdry.world'></a></p>\n",

We welcome students, industry scientists, folks working in other fields that have links to E&amp;E, scientific societies, and nature enthusiasts in general. If you want to join us you almost certainly belong, so please apply!</p>\n\n<p>Please use the English language in the &quot;reasons for joining&quot; field, this simplifies a lot the admins&#39; work. Translation tools are very easy to use and I&#39;d greatly appreciate if this step is done by the user beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>Two ways of signing-up:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1) Ask someone already a user to provide you with an invitation link (<code>Parameters &gt; Invite people</code>). This will bypass approval by moderators and would be the preferred way of growing our network.</li>\n<li>2) Otherwise, simply follow the <code>Create account</code> button and provide in a sentence or two your relation to Ecology and Evolution. While a website, a program enrolment or a publication record provides a quick confirmation and will allow moderators to work through the queue faster, they are not necessary and we will consider anyone who expresses interest.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See you soon on the server and enjoy connecting!</p>\n\n<p>Admin is US Pacific time based, so expect no answers when he&#39;s sleeping.</p>\n\n<p>Server thumbnail: The Mastodon giganteus of North America - Plate I, John Collins Warren, 1852, DOI: https://doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.62016</p>\n",

Check out their profile!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This server aims to provide a safe space for 18+ furry ABDLs who identify with any age, be they babyfur, kidfur, teenfur, caretaker, and so on! This server is open to anyone who partakes in or is curious about the furry ABDL community. All fluffies, scalies, and humans are welcome, crinkling not required! However, expect to see many types of crinkly critters, their photos, and their art on this instance.</p>\n\n<p>Please be aware that this <em>is</em> an ABDL/babyfur space and as such our Content Warning policy around ABDL material may be more relaxed than other furry servers.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Our name is cubhub.social but cub porn is NOT allowed.</em>\n<hr /></p>\n\n<h2>Why The Name?</h2>\n\n<p>I picked the name &#39;CubHub.social&#39; because, despite the current negative connotation around the word &#39;cub&#39;, CubHubs were the first places at furry conventions I felt safe being an ABDL while also coming to grips with my furry side. For those who don&#39;t know, CubHubs are private rooms/party rooms that serve as safe spaces for babyfurs, kidfurs, diaperfurs, etc at conventions. Before ABDLs were as accepted into the fandom as they are now, CubHubs were the only place where it was absolutely safe to be yourself. So, yeah, I couldn&#39;t think of a better ethos to bring to the Fediverse. I want CubHub to be a safe space on Fedi for all fuzzy ABDLs.\n<hr /></p>\n\n<h1>Content Warnings &amp; Moderation</h1>\n\n<h2>Content Warnings</h2>\n\n<p>We require warnings on certain types of material posted in both text posts and image posts.</p>\n\n<h3>FAQs for Content Warnings on Media:</h3>\n\n<p>This list is <strong>not</strong> exhaustive. These are simply the CWs we get asked about the most. Please read the Rules Section below for a more general but comprehensive list.</p>\n\n<h4>No Content Warning Needed:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ABDL Clothing </li>\n<li>Clean or Soggy Diapers </li>\n<li>SFW ABDL/Furry Art</li>\n<li>Fursuits</li>\n<li>Pup Hoods and Harnesses if Clothed Underneath</li>\n<li>Light/Cutesy Age Regression or Hypnosis</li>\n<li>Diaper Pats/Play Swatting</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Content Warning Needed:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Political Posts</li>\n<li>Depictions or Detailed Descriptions of Drug/Alcohol Use</li>\n<li>Nudity or Sex/Yiff</li>\n<li>Leaking or Messy Diapers</li>\n<li>Watersports/Wetting Through Clothes</li>\n<li><em>Obvious</em> Erections Under Clothing/Tented Diapers</li>\n<li>Murrsuits With Genitalia Showing</li>\n<li>Heavy/Extreme Bondage</li>\n<li>Needles</li>\n<li>Heavier Age Regression or Hypnosis (unwilling subjects, mental destruction-- use your best judgment here since it&#39;s a gray area)</li>\n<li>Spanking/Red Cheeks/Impact Play</li>\n<li>Every story post regardless of whether it&#39;s SFW just so users know what they&#39;re reading before they do.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Recommended But Not Required</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ABDL/Furry Fandom Discourse</li>\n<li>Photos Cropped to a Diapered Crotch/Butt</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Note: You cannot use content warnings too much! If you&#39;re on the fence or you&#39;d rather CW a post even if it&#39;s not required, we recommend that you do so. It also helps when users follow you who may not be into the same subject matter as you are!</em></p>\n\n<h2>Content Warning How-To</h2>\n\n<p>There is a ⚠️ button under your post compose box. When clicking on it, it&#39;ll open a new text box that&#39;ll let you fill out a description of the post content.</p>\n\n<p>When tagging, be concise but also descriptive of the contents of the post. Examples being, don&#39;t say &#39;NSFW&#39; but instead try &#39;Messy Diapers&#39; or &#39;M/M Yiff&#39;. Similarly, don&#39;t say &#39;News&#39;, try &#39;US Politics, Elections&#39; to help out non-US users. </p>\n\n<p>Content warning moderation isn&#39;t particularly strict. If your post is missing a Content Warning, a staff member will usually mark it as sensitive and ask that you add CW tags to it. If the user doesn&#39;t respond to the request, a moderator will delete the post and let the user redraft it with the CW&#39;s included. Repeatedly failing to use CWs will result in a time-out and your video games taken away.</p>\n\n<h2>Moderation</h2>\n\n<p>Failure to adhere to the server rules may lead to something as simple as a warning, up through content removal, silencing, and a ban. If you feel action taken against you was incorrect, you may appeal the action to the administration. However, we have a zero tolerance policy for hate speech or pro-fascist imagery of any kind, and it will result in an immediate ban with no appeal. <em>Nazi symbols, Confederate imagery, Pro-Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Blue Lives Matter talk are all unwelcome here.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Reporting Posts</h2>\n\n<p>If a post violates our rules, we ask that users fill out a report for the moderation staff. Please do not confront other users directly.</p>\n\n<h3>Reporting Posts from Other Instances</h3>\n\n<p>If a post from another server appears in our federated timeline and has content that breaks our rules, please report it! If it&#39;s art that&#39;s simply missing a CW, a moderator can mark it as sensitive. If it&#39;s something more egregious, the user or even the instance can be limited or defederated from us. </p>\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Please do <strong>not</strong> select the &quot;Forward to [instance]&quot; option in the report unless you verify that the post breaks the rules of their home server as well. Servers have different rules and what may be inappropriate here may be entirely appropriate elsewhere!\n<hr /></p>\n\n<h1>Tips &amp; Tricks</h1>\n\n<h2>Hashtags</h2>\n\n<h3>Using Hashtags</h3>\n\n<p>Using hashtags immensely boosts the visibility of your posts! Because there are no algorithms, it&#39;s up to users to find the content they want to see. As such, using hashtags makes discoverability much easier. <code>#FurryArt</code>, <code>#ABDLArt</code>, or <code>#BabyfurArt</code> are all hashtags people are following and will mean your post will be seen by more users.</p>\n\n<h3>Following Hashtags</h3>\n\n<p>Mastodon allows you to follow hashtags so you can have any posts tagged with a hashtag show up in your Home timeline. To follow a hashtag, type the hashtag you want to follow in the search box then hit the follow button in the top right corner.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying</h2>\n\n<p>As our community has such a large roleplaying community, we recommend users indicate whether or not they roleplay in their profile. Users looking to roleplay should check the profile of the person they&#39;re interacting with to see if they&#39;re up for it and ask if they&#39;re unsure.</p>\n\n<h2>Image Accessibility</h2>\n\n<p>When posting images, we implore all users to include a description of what is in the image by providing alt text. To add alt text, click the edit button while you&#39;re posting your picture and fill in the details under &quot;Describe for the visually impaired&quot; and save it. This really helps users with accessibility needs! Many Mastodon users will only boost images with alt text, so it&#39;s a good habit to get into.</p>\n\n<h2>Markdown In Posts</h2>\n\n<p>You can use Markdown in your posts by clicking the icon below the compose box that looks like a sheet of paper, then clicking <code>Markdown</code>. You can set your posts to default to Markdown by going into your <code>Settings &gt; Preferences &gt; Other &gt; Default format for toots</code> and selecting <code>Markdown</code>. </p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re new to markdown, try this <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus\">Markdown Tool</a> here.</p>\n\n<h2>Federation</h2>\n\n<p>Any user you follow from another instance will then federate with our server. This means any and all posts they make will appear on our federated timeline, unless the server has been limited (see the Moderated Servers section below).</p>\n\n<p>If a user/post isn&#39;t federated with us that you want to follow/like/boost, you can copy the link to the user/post into the CubHub search box and our server will federate it, thus allowing you to interact.</p>\n\n<h2>CubHub Interface Tweaks</h2>\n\n<p>Our server runs a version of Mastodon based on <a href=\"https://github.com/Taullo/Ruffy\">Ruffy</a> that&#39;s a fork of <a href=\"https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/\">Glitch-Soc</a>. Ruffy has a two-column theme, customizable accent colors, emoji reactions, and much more.</p>\n\n<p>To see all of the available options to tweak the look of CubHub, click the two cog wheels in the top right of the desktop interface, or <code>Interface settings</code> in the overflow menu of the mobile interface on the bottom right!</p>\n\n<h2>Mobile Apps</h2>\n\n<p>While the default Mastodon mobile app is <em>good enough</em>, it&#39;s missing features that are custom to CubHub. To this end, we recommend that Android users use either <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.joinmastodon.android.sk&pli=1\">Megalodon</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.joinmastodon.android.moshinda\">Moshidon</a>. From there, users can go to <code>Overflow Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Instance</code> and turn on <code>Enable post formatting</code>, <code>Enable emoji reactions</code>, and <code>Server supports local-only posting</code> and make sure <code>Glitch local-only mode</code> is off.\n<hr /></p>\n\n<h1>Server Information</h1>\n\n<h2>Transparency Pledge</h2>\n\n<p>We want to run this instance with as much transparency as possible. Please, if users have any questions at all, contact anyone on the moderation or administration staff. If there are any moderation questions, technical questions about the server, and so on, we&#39;d be more than glad to answer them.</p>\n\n<h2>The Server&#39;s Longevity</h2>\n\n<p>A lot of users have concerns about admins abruptly shutting down their instances and the users losing what they&#39;ve built. CubHub is completely and utterly committed to keeping the server going long-term and continuing to be a place for furry ABs, DLs, middles, grown-ups, etc to congregate. However, in the event of something catastrophic, here is our pledge:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If the admin is unable to continue to administrating the server, the server will be handed over to someone the community has approved of running the instance.</li>\n<li>If a replacement can&#39;t be found, the server will remain up for <strong>at least</strong> 30 days from the initial notice of closure, so users can migrate their content and their followers to a new instance with plenty of notice.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>A Note From Rusty: This is like some worst case scenario stuff, but I want people to feel safe hosting their content here and know there&#39;s a backup plan in the event of catastrophe. I love running this instance and I love this community and I really don&#39;t wanna go anywhere!</em></p>\n\n<h2>Server Costs</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Server Host:</strong> $72.00 Monthly</li>\n<li><strong>Daily Backups:</strong> $10.00 Monthly</li>\n<li><strong>S3 Storage:</strong> ≈$2.00 Monthly</li>\n<li><strong>Domain Registrar:</strong> $46.16 Yearly</li>\n<li><strong>Email Server:</strong> $95.00 Bi-Yearly</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Note: Our S3 storage hosts things like our pictures, videos, and other media. It tends to fluctuate and should very slowly climb in cost over time, though likely not by much.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Custom Emojis</h2>\n\n<p>If you would like to see a particular emoji set added, please DM the administration! <em>Tip: You can hover the mouse cursor over or tap on an emoji in a post or profile to expand it and see it better.</em></p>\n\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://volpeon.ink/emojis/blobfox/\">Blobfox</a>, <a href=\"https://volpeon.ink/emojis/bunhd/\">BunHD</a>, <a href=\"https://volpeon.ink/emojis/drgn/\">drgn</a>, <a href=\"https://volpeon.ink/emojis/fox/\">Fox</a>, <a href=\"https://volpeon.ink/emojis/neofox/\">Neofox</a>, <a href=\"https://volpeon.ink/emojis/raccoon/\">Raccoon</a>, and <a href=\"https://volpeon.ink/emojis/vlpn/\">vlpn</a> custom emoji packs are created and provided by <a href=\"https://volpeon.ink/emojis/\">Volpeon</a>!

            "full_description": "<h2>About Fediscience.org</h2>\n\n<p>FediScience is a social network for publishing scientists. Everyone is welcome to join from PhD student to professor, as well as researchers from outside of academia. You are welcome to stay afterwards, but it is also easy to change to another server.</p>\n\n<p>There will be a lot of science talk on this server, but there is no need to only talk science.</p>\n\n<p>This site is owned and operated by the charitable association FediScience e.V. and other volunteers from the FediScience community.</p>\n\n<h2>Imprint / Impressum</h2>\n\n<p>\nFediScience e.V.</br>\nBahnhofstraße 22</br>\n85354 Freising</br>\n08161 / 2408483</br>\nsupport@fediscience.org\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFediScience e.V. is registered in Munich, Germany</br>\nRegistration no: VR 240410</br>\n<p>\nBoard members:</br>\nFrank Sonntag (chair & treasurer)</br>\nChristian Meesters (deputy)</br>\nTatjana Scheffler (secretary)</br>\nBahnhofstraße 22</br>\n85354 Freising</br>\n08161 / 2408483</br>\nsupport@fediscience.org\n</p>\n\n<h2>About the registration process</h2>\n\n<p>\nFediScience is a community for active scientists. Establishing the exact definition of \"science\" and who is actively contributing to it is a long-standing open problem (<a hred=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem</a>). \n</p>\n\n<p>\nTherefore, we need to fix a criterium. We have opted to assume that researchers currently publishing in scientific journals are active scientists, knowing the potential limitations of this definition. To register on FediScience, you'll need to provide us with evidence that you are working as a publishing scientist or aspiring to be one, by sending us a link to your ORCID, academic web page, or similar where we can see your contributions. We will not save or use this information for anything other than the verification process. For students or junior researchers who have not yet published a paper - no problem! Just explain your situation. It will help us if you can add a link where we can see that you are affiliated with a research institution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOther edge cases will be moderated on an individual basis. If you really think that you are a good match for the FediScience community, please apply and carefully explain your situation.\n</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"code-of-conduct\">Code of conduct</h2>\n\n<p>As many people as possible should feel welcome at FediScience, so please follow the code of conduct.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You do not have to give your name, but please tell us about your expertise and interests in your bio and introduce yourself using the #introductions hashtag.</li>\n<li>Don’t do anything that’s illegal in Germany or where you live.</li>\n<li>We want to be inclusive; do not engage in exclusionary behaviour or language. Consider not only the current interaction, but how it would be if your behaviour were common.</li>\n<li>Don’t harass people. Respect it if people want to stop an interaction. Sexual attention can constitute harassment, even if it wasn’t intended to cause upset.</li>\n<li>Please relax. Don’t assume you know better than the person you’re talking to.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Users violating these rules may have their accounts suspended and will not be welcome to take part any more.</p>\n\n<p>If you are subject to or observe any harassment, or have any other concerns, please report the toot concerned or message a moderator. Reports will be dealt with discreetly and in confidence.</p>\n\n<p>We want everyone to have a great time and treat each other with respect.</p>\n\n<h2>Use of the Content Warning (CW) feature</h2>\n\n<p>Mastodon has Content Warnings, please use them. They can be used to collapse a long (series) of messages, but also to hide topics some may find upsetting, especially when people would not expect this kind of content in your stream, e.g., when you are not talking about your area of expertise.</p>\n\n<p>At the bottom of the message editor you can click the \"CW\" button; anything in the small warning field above your larger message editor field will be visible. The reader will have to click on \"Show more\" to see the full message.</p>\n\n<h2>Use of bots and cross-posters</h2>\n\n<p>It is fine to use apps or services which generate toots automatically, but please make sure that you have them under control: make sure they are relevant, try to limit it to a few posts a day. Mark the account as bot. When using bots and cross-posters visit FediScience regularly, if only to interact with replies.</p>\n\n<h2>Support Mastodon and FediScience</h2>\n\n<p>The best way to help is to spread the word! If you starting using Mastodon and find it useful then help out by telling other people about it.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple people have kindly offered to support FediScience financially and since we are getting so many new people onboard that we can make use of the funds to support the infrastructure and moderation costs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://liberapay.com/fediscience/donate\"><img alt=\"Donate using Liberapay\" src=\"https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg\"></a><br>\nLiberapay is a not-for-profit financed by donations itself. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://patreon.com/user?u=82504769\">Patreon</a><br>\nis a for-profit and more expensive, but we offer it for people's convenience\n</p>\n",

            "full_description": "<h2>FAQ</h2>\n\n<h3>What is Sigmoid Social?</h3>\n\n<p>Sigmoid Social is a Mastodon instance for people researching, working on, or just interested in AI. We went live on 11/04/2022.</p>\n\n<h3>Who should join Sigmoid Social?</h3>\n\n<p>You should join Sigmoid Social if you would like to be part of a Mastodon community primarily focused on discussing AI. We do not gatekeep who can join; it does not matter whether you are a researcher, engineer, hacker, student, artist, or just curious.</p>\n\n<h3>Who runs Sigmoid Social?</h3>\n\n<p>Sigmoid Social is administered and maintained by <a href=\"thegradient.pub\">The Gradient</a>. The Gradient is a non-profit and volunteer-run organization with the mission of facilitating discussion within the AI community. We were founded in 2017 by a group of students and researchers at the Stanford AI Lab. Our current projects include The Gradient Magazine, The Gradient Podcast, The Update newsletter, and Sigmoid Social.</p>\n\n<h3>Should I only post about AI?</h3>\n\n<p>You can feel free to toot about anything at all, as long as it complies with the Code of Conduct. We may however ask you to migrate to a different instance if your focus is not AI at all.</p>\n\n<h3>Should I only post in English?</h3>\n\n<p>This server supports translation, so it is ok to post in other languages than English. But, as English as the primary language here, that should ideally be the primary language you use. If you do post in other languages, please tag your posts with the appropriate language label.</p>\n\n<h3>Will you ban me for X?</h3>\n\n<p>We will take appropriate moderation measures against any violations of the Code of Conduct. We also reserve the right to take actions in the best interest of the community in situations we deem harmful but do not clearly violate the Code of Conduct. We will generally lean towards promoting free expression and issuing warning and restrictions rather than bans, but this is absolutely not a free-speech-above-all platform.</p>\n\n<h3>How can I help cover costs?</h3>\n\n<p>You can support us on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/sigmoidsocial\">Patreon</a> or <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/sigmoidsocial\">Kofi</a>!</p>\n\n<h3>How can I share suggestions for Sigmoid Social?</h3>\n\n<p>You can message The Gradient via Mastodon, email, Twitter, or pigeon.</p>\n\n<h3>Where is my data stored?</h3>\n\n<p>Sigmoid Social is hosted by <a href=\"masto.host\">MastHost</a>, a fully managed Mastodon hosting service provided by WAP – Web Access Platforms. WAP is a one-person company 100% owned and administrated by Hugo Gameiro. All data storage and processing is done through MastHost.</p>\n\n<h3>What happens if The Gradient can no longer maintain Sigmoid Social?</h3>\n\n<p>In the case that our current team can no longer run Sigmoid Social, we will attempt to transfer control of it to another non-profit entity within the AI community. If we are unable to do this, we will announce the closure of Sigmoid Social within at least 30 days to allow users to transfer their accounts to other Mastodon instances.\n\n<h3>Can you access my private DMs?</h3>\n<p>The only way we can access private communications from Sigmoid Social is through exporting the database stored by MastoHost. We will do this periodically for the purpose of storing backups, and in case we have to migrate to another hosting solution. We <b>will not</b> inspect the database for any other reasons. Regardless, we recommend not sharing any private or secure information on this platform.</p>\n\n<h3>What is your policy in AI Art and NFTs?</h3>\n\n<p>This instance is a great fit for anyone who wants to post AI art - we fully support it. We are also OK with NFT promotion, as long as it relates to AI art and is not spammy.</p>\n\n<h3>Why does the banner spell out \"Sigmioid\"</h3>\n\n<p>We generated our banner using MidJourney (a text-to-image AI tool), and intentionally picked out an image that contained a typo as a little in-joke about these tools.</p>\n\n<h2>Recommended Practices & Mastodon tips</h2>\n\n<p>Here are some recommended practices for helping make Sigmoid Social a great place for everyone here:\n<ul>\n<li>Browse the local feed when starting out. Mastodon has three types of feeds: home (people or hashtags you follow), local (all posts from this instance), and federated (all posts from this instance and any users from other instances that are follow by anyone on here). Until you follow some people or hashtags, the local feed is your best bet for discovering content.</li>\n<li>Use hashtags. Mastodon does not have an algorithmic feed, so hashtags are often used for finding content relevant to your interests. So, using hashtags will make it easier for others to find and follow you, and for you to find others as well. We list a set of recommended hashtags below!</li>\n<li>Use the unlisted privacy setting in replies and threads. The default post privacy in Mastodon is &#39;global&#39;, which gets posted to the local timeline, whereas &#39;unlisted&#39; is only shown when browsing the replies to a given post. Using unlisted for most replies and threads makes the timeline less cleaner and nicer to browse.</li>\n<li>Look into the non-official apps for Mastodon. There are some apps not made by Mastodon that provide an arguably better frontend. Examples include Tusky and Toot!</li>\n<li>Consider using content warnings/content labels. The CW button when writing posts stands for &#39;content warning&#39;, and then you include one in your post only the text for it is shown unless a user presses a button to see the rest of the post. We recommend using it for sensitive content, but you can also use them like a subject line or TLDR as well!</li>\n<li>Explore Mastodon notification options. Mastodon allows you to mute various types of notifications, which can make it easier to focus on just replies and ignore favorites or boosts if you prefer to do so.</li>\n<li>Report any content you think might violate the code of conduct. Moderation on Mastodon primarily relies on the users reporting objectionable content, at which point our mods can take care of it. Reporting bad content will make the experience on Sigmoid Social better for everyone!</li>\n<li>Aim to be generally civil and friendly :) \n</ul></p>\n\n<h3>Hashtags</h3>\n\n<p>As is true for Mastodon in general, we recommend you use hashtags in your posts. The following are just some you may want to use:</p> \n\n<ul>\n<li>#introduction - for introducing yourself!</li>\n<li>#ai - for stuff related to AI!</li>\n<li>#NewPaper - for sharing new papers!</li>\n<li>#PaperThread - for threads summarizing your or others' papers!</li>\n<li>#arxiv- for stuff related to arxiv!</li>\n<li>#SOTA -  for stuff related to state of the art!</li>\n<li>#NLProc - for stuff related to NLP!</li>\n<li>#CV - for stuff related to computer vision!</li>\n<li>#RL - for stuff related to reinforcement learning!</li>\n<li>#genAI - for stuff related to generative AI!</li>\n<li>#llm - for stuff related to language models!</li>\n<li>#reviews - for stuff related reviews!</li>\n<li>#conference - for stuff related to conferences!</li>\n<li>#deadline - for stuff related to deadlines!</li>\n<li>#aiart - for AI art!</li>\n<li>#academia - for stuff related to academia!</li>\n<li>#industry - for stuff related to industry!</li>\n<li>#PetPics - for pet pics!</li>\n<li>#question - for questions!</li>\n<li>#discussion - for discussions!</li>\n<li>#announcement - for announcements!</li>\n<li>#hiring - if you're hiring!</li>\n<li>#JobHunt - if you're job hunting!</li>\n<li>#code - for stuff related to code!</li>\n<li>#news - for news!</li>\n<li>#interesting - for interesting stuff!</li>\n<li>#concerning - for concerning stuff!</li>\n<li>#cool - for cool stuff!</li>\n<li>#SuperCool - for super cool stuff!</li>\n<li>#lame - for lame stuff!</li>\n<li>#SuperLame - for super lame stuff!</li>\n<li>#funny - for funny stuff!</li>\n<li>#SuperFunny - for super funny stuff!</li>\n<li>#MindBlown - for mind blowing stuff!</li>\n<li>#ethics - for stuff related to ethics!</li>\n<li>#fun - for fun stuff!</li>\n<li>#GoodMorning - for wishing everyone a good morning!</li>\n<li>#GoodNight - for wishing everyone a good night!</li>\n<li>#serious - for serious stuff!</li>\n<li>#random - for random stuff!</li>\n<li>#TIL - for new stuff you've learned!</li>\n<li>#scifi - for discussing science fiction!</li>\n<li>#media - for discussion of movies, books, comics, etc</li>\n<li>#SigmoidSocial - for stuff related to Sigmoid Social</li>\n<li>#TOOTTOOT - just to add a little fun flair to your toots :P</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>\n\n<p>Sigmoid Social is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>We want this community to maintain a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. In keeping with these aims, we do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from Sigmoid Social at the discretion of the organizers of the Gradient.</p>\n\n<p>Harassment, including the following activities, will not be tolerated:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.</li>\n<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.</li>\n<li>Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.</li>\n<li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.</li>\n<li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like \"hug\" or “backrub“) without consent or after a request to stop.</li><li>Threats of violence.</li>\n<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.</li>\n<li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>\n<li>Stalking or following.</li>\n<li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.</li>\n<li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>\n<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>\n<li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others. Sigmoid Social is intended to be a welcoming platform, so while friendships in support of research are encouraged, note that Sigmoid Social is not a dating platform. Flirting or other unprofessional behavior may make someone uncomfortable. If a member requests another member to stop this type of behavior and it continues, it will be considered harassment.</li>\n<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.</li>\n<li>Deliberate \"outing\" of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.</li>\n<li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li>\n<li>Impersonation with the intent to deceive users (satire is ok).</li>\n<li>Explicitly rude or degrading remarks in general.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"reporting\">Reporting</h3><p>If you are being harassed by a user of Sigmoid Social, notice that someone else is being harassed, believe confidentiality has been violated, or have any other concerns, please report this via the standard Mastodon tools. We will respond as promptly as we can.</p>\n\n<p>organizers reserve the right to exclude people from Sigmoid Social based on their past behavior, including behavior outside  Sigmoid Social.</p>\n\n<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the members Sigmoid Social or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consequences\">Consequences</h3>\n\n<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>\n\n<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from Sigmoid Social and identification of the participant as a harasser to other members of Mastodon.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"credit-and-license\">Credit and License</h3><p>This policy is licensed under the Creative Commons Zero license.

This server is for people to be able to express themselves by sharing their creations, talk about their interests, or just be themselves in an environment that doesn't allow harassment to flourish. In contrast to other environments online, we also want to be a safe space for marginalized individuals including queer folks, people of color, and women by disallowing hateful speech and ideals.</p>\n\n<p>As advertisers become prevalent in online spaces, many sites limit what type of content is allowed in order to appease them. From banning nudity all the way to banning strange and niche kinks! By contrast, Aethy embraces and loves the human body! We love when adults get kinky and sometimes downright strange with their sexuality! We don't believe in regressive ideologies that limit creative speech and content between consenting adults. With that belief in mind, we made Aethy. The policies were envisioned and sculpted by people who've dealt with hate all their lives, as well as experiencing mental, physical, and sexual abuse (both as minors and as adults). It's extremely important to us that we create a safe space for our community so we've built the site on the principles of inclusion and consent.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of continuing to be squeezed out of spaces because perhaps we're too weird, too queer, or too kinky... we've made our own space! We don't think there's any wrong way to express ourselves as long as we adhere to the principles of consent and inclusion! We no longer want to inhabit spaces where we're beholden to advertisers, puritans and those that wish to spread hate!</p>\n\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/#chat:aethy.com\">Matrix Space</a>!</p></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"about__section\">\n<div class=\"about__section__title\">Donate</div>\n\n<div class=\"about__section__body\">\nHelp us run Aethy! We take donations via the following means:\n\n<a href=\"https://aethy.fanbox.cc/\" alt=\"Pixiv Fanbox\"><img src=\"https://cdn.aethy.com/media_attachments/files/112/085/346/760/515/035/original/04fb31bc12971033.png\" /></a>\n\n<p>Here's the cost breakdown for running Aethy:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Server hosting: $72 per month</li>\n<li>Domain name: $14.76 per year</li>\n<li>Email: $48 per year</li>\n<li>Storage: ~$30 per month</li>\n<li>Translation Services: ~$40 per month</li>\n<li>CDN: $280 per year</li>\n<li>PO Box (DMCA Requirement): $166 per year</li></ul></div></div>\n\n<p></div></div></p>\n\n<div class=\"about__section\">\n<div class=\"about__section__title\">FAQ</div>\n\n<div class=\"about__section__body\">\n<h1>Content Warnings</h1>\n<h3>What is a <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span> or \"CW?\"</h3>\n\n<p><span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span> or a \"CW\" is short for \"Content Warning\". When a user is making a post, they have the option to click a button that has a <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span> symbol. This is used to warn other users about content they might not wish to see (such as sexual or violent content).</p>\n\n<h3>What content needs a <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span>?</h3>\n\n<p>Public and Unlisted Posts that contain sexual themes, gore, and depictions/discussions of sensitive topics require warnings. Any media where the intent is to arouse is included in this (even if a censor bar or a blur effect is applied). This also includes images where the subject is posed in a sexual manner, or if a body part is framed in an attempt to be arousing. Light blood doesn't require a <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span> but beyond that, a <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span> is most likely required. Finally, sensitive topics include politics, religion, spirituality, niche belief systems, abuse (including relationship which would be abusive in reality), current events and other topics that could potentially upset someone.</p>\n\n<p>Just do your best though! No one is gonna get in trouble unless they're intentionally trying to upset other users!</p>\n\n<h3>What happens if I forget to add a <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span>?</h3>\n\n<p>The best thing to do is to quickly edit your post and add one. Otherwise, you'll receive a reminder from a staff member reminding you to add one provided the post content isn't deemed to be too upsetting! Staff members will also typically give suggestions as to what tags may be appropriate. However, if the lack of a <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span> on a post could be extremely distressing to viewers, the post may be deleted and need to be redrafted from your email. Accounts that ignore staff warnings may also be Limited so the posts don't appear in public timelines and all images will be marked as \"sensitive\". To have the Limited status removed, simply edit your posts to include a <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span> and then appeal the Limited status. Punitive action will never be taken, we will simply put measures in place to protect other users from content they may wish to avoid!</p>\n\n<h3>What if my <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span>s aren't good enough?</h3>\n\n<p>Try your best! If the <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span>s aren't comprehensive enough, the staff's course of action will be similar to the above. As a general rule of thumb, try to avoid simply marking a post as \"NSFW\" or something similar. Ask yourself why it's NSFW and list those reasons in the CW. Also avoid overly broad CWs such as \"Nudity\", \"Age Gap\", \"Dead Dove\", etc. Be specific about the subjects and what content is involved!</p>\n\n<h3>What's an example of a <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span>?</h3>\n\n<p>Examples for sexual content are \"Kink\", \"Sex\", \"Sexual Nudity\", \"Boner\", \"Erection\", \"Het\", \"GL\", “BL”, “MLM”, “Anal”, “Blowjob”, “Boner”, “Blood”, “Gore”, “Vore”, “Macro”, \"Age gap\", “Underage”, \"Shota\", \"Loli\", “Minor/Adult”, \"Teen/Adult\", etc.</p>\n\n<p>An example for a heavier topic could include \"Politics\", \"Hate Speech\", \"Harassment\", \"Discourse\", \"Syscourse\", etc.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to religion, spirituality and niche belief systems and frameworks, some examples are \"Spirituality, \"Religion\", \"Otherkin\", \"Therian\", \"Christian\", \"Jesus\", etc.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, the more specific you can get, the better! But you also don't have to make an essay out of it! However, please avoid using loaded words that can be used synonymously with real abuse as <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span>s. <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span>s are meant to allow people to avoid content they don't wish to see and should do so without causing distress to others.</p>\n\n<h3>Does simple nudity require a <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span>?</h3>\n\n<p>Nope! Content warnings are not required for non-sexual nudity (e.g. images that don't feature close-ups of genitals, boners, or sex acts). Basically, if it's an image you'd find in an art museum or if the intention of the content isn't to arouse, it doesn't need a <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span>. This policy doesn't discriminate against age or body type either. If the subject is a real adult and has consented, or if it's a fictional drawing, then nudity is no different than if the subject is clothed! This also means images that contain nudity can be used in profile icons and banners!</p>\n\n<p>You’re still free to use content warnings when they’re not required, however!</p>\n\n<h3>What counts as sexual or erotic?</h3>\n\n<p>Any image where the intent is to arouse or where the subjects featured are engaged in a sexual act. This may even include images that don't feature sexual nudity such as images that contain bodily fluids or where the subject(s) are posed in a sexual nature. It also includes images that attempt to censor the sexual content (e.g. placing a bar over a boner or blurring it). Basically, if it's obvious what's going on, it needs a <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span>!</p>\n\n<h3>Can I boost content from another server that doesn't have a <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span>?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes! We don't want to discourage interacting with other servers even when their policies relating to <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span>s differ from ours. Users are encouraged to proceed with caution when viewing posts from other servers. However, if a post isn't marked as \"sensitive\" when it would be required to have a <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span> on Aethy, please report it so we can mark it ourselves!</p>\n\n<h1>Acceptable Content</h1>\n\n<h3>Can I post content I don't own the rights to?</h3>\n\n<p>This isn't legal advice but typically screenshots, cropped comic panels, clips from television, etc. fall under Fair Use in the United States. This also includes fan art, fan fiction, and other such content. Staff members will not typically remove content from mass media properties that we believe to fall under Fair Use. However, if a user uploads full television episodes or movies, copyrighted music, and other such content, it will be removed and the user suspended as it is not Fair Use. Also, when it comes to independent creators, we ask that you do not repost their creations (e.g. artwork, photos, videos, etc.) without the creator's permission. We also ask that you don't include their characters in your creations in a way that could cause duress (e.g. drawing sexual imagery of someone's mascot character without their permission).</p>\n\n<h3>Can I upload works created with AI?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes but it must be disclosed. AI assisted works (such as art where background elements are created by AI) simply require disclosure of the tool used in the post body. However, when posting works created entirely (or nearly entirely) by AI, a <span title=\"Content Warning\" class=\"fa fa-warning fa-fw\" /></span> must be added indicating that it's AI generated and what tool was used to create it. However, works that were created by directly modifying someone else's copyrighted content may not be posted unless the original content falls under Fair Use. The AI used must also have been trained in a clean room environment that wasn't trained using real human subjects. Especially in the case of pictures featuring underage characters.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"about__section\">\n<div class=\"about__section__title\">Policies</div>\n\n<div class=\"about__section__body\">\n\n<p>Our policies are available on our <a href=\"https://aethy.com/privacy-policy\">Policies page</a>.

Mastodonは検索機能が弱いと聞いたけど？</h2>\n\n<p>kmyblueは特別な処理を追加しているため、他のMastodonより検索がつよつよです。ただ、それでもMisskeyにはかないません。</p>\n\n<h2>Q. 政治の話は禁止ですか？</h2>\n\n<p>特定人物・団体を批判する文脈で「ゴミ」「バカ」という言葉を使ったら投稿削除します。全面禁止ではありませんが、他のSNSよりかなり厳しいです。</p>\n\n<h1>kmyblueの独自機能</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>スタンプ</strong> -
